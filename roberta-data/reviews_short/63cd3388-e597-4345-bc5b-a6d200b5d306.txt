Customer Service is excellent
Had to wait 20 minutes to get help, but after that all went well.  All my questions were answered and some information changed.  Also was given a short tutorial.
My general experience is remarkable as it accomplishes the work which I needed to accomplish for my business projects.
It has taken some time to work through the set-up but we really like the accounting and reports that work really well.
