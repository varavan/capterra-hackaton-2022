A waste of time.  Maybe if you paid them lots of money you will get more information about the project, but since they invited me to bid, I was expecting more than just the name of the project.  I tried emailing them, but the email got bounced back.  I am not sure if they are a real company.
Very good experience.
Overall the website has many qualified leads. 
This software definitely has 'bang for buck'. All of the things teachers are able to do through this platform certainly impress me. I started teaching 40 years ago and everything was done in hardcopy by hand. Wow, what a difference. What has impressed me the most, and continues to impress me, is your customer support. My questions are answered quickly and always with courtesy too. I feel like I am dealing with real people who care about my ability to use their product with as much ease as possible. It is an absolute pleasure doing business with you.
