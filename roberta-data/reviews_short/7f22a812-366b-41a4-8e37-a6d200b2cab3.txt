For the cost of the system there needs to be better and quicker way around the chart. From making appointments all the way thru a visit there are many clicks that slow down the visit. Even when done there is too many items to be completed even when everything is mapped and templates are made with order sets. 
We have been using Athena since Aug. of 2012.  We have been very pleased with all three products.  I love that Athena is on the cutting edge of technology and leading the market in its field.
Updates have been challenging, some are nice, overall not as easy to navigate, a lot of additional "clicking", not as user friendly - more time consuming
I was doing chart abstractions from home using the new Athena. I'd previously used the old Athena, in office, doing patient work ups & such. The new system is better & clearer, easier to use. I stopped working from home about a year ago, so it's been a little while since I've actually used Athena, but I do remember it's simpler!
