This product has allowed me to create a general quote in less than 2hrs compared to almost an entire day.  Prior to getting Stack I would get the plans via email, dig out what my print team had to print out for me, mark the plans, lose my count after marking or being interrupted, and spend almost an entire day going through each floor to label for my counts.  Now I just upload, create general take offs, and mark mark mark!  
This program has cut our take off time by 50% and we get an accurate take off report when we are done. I highly recommend this to any steel fabricator. 
Highly recommend. 
STACK is easy to learn and easy to use. The staff at STACK are amazing and extremely helpful! I couldn't imagine my life without this company!
