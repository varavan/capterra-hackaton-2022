Workable, how do I love thee?  It's impossible to list all the ways!!

If your looking for a main applicant tracking system or a supplement to the one you have, Workable is well worth it.

My rating would actually be a strong 4.5 stars.
i've hired more than a dozen people using workable in the last 6 months.
it's convenient but you may find it a little expensive unless you're constantly hiring.
With this software it is really easy to choose new high quality personnel thanks to the fact that it allows you to follow the profile of each candidate and interview several at the same time, knowing not only our opinion about them but also that of other people and this is advantageous because that way you have more vigilance about who was chosen is really suitable for that job.
Having the process of recruitment from advertising to hiring so organized and easy was a life changer to a company like mine that has a big employee turnover once we work with Fixed Term contract and projects that are always changing.
