My personal experience has been great. When speaking with potential clients, if they have certain preferences on equipment needs, I can easy access our inventory to see off we have that particular equipment instantly. It is just very easy to use. It's not clunky in any way.
It has solved our problem to call and ask everybody who got this or that tool... =)

We use the software for tracking our construction equipment (tools, ladders, cords, benders, job boxes, temporary lighting, etc.).
