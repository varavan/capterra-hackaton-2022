Â Our previous purchased backup software was not smooth in upgrading..

I was pleasantly surprised to see how well Cohesity performed and how easy it was to set it up. Took us a couple of hours and then  we tested a few backups and restores, and everything was running smoothly.
We use Cohesity for backup and recovery primarily, though we are starting to look into it for file service as well. We perform on-premises backups of Exchange, SQL, SharePoint, VDI Golden Images, and a host of Windows Servers and Linux Applications. The product makes it surprisingly easy to search for folders and files. The elastic search puts Cohesity above the competition. We will be leveraging the long term retention to the cloud later this year, but with the level of support that we receive from Cohesity, we don't anticipate any issues.

Great! Cohesity has been integral to our ransomware mitigation and backup/disaster recovery systems. It has the added benefit of being able to perform additional stuff like Data Classification and searching.
Overall Cohesity has been one of the best vendors we have ever worked with. Their support team started very small and I usually got the same 2 or 3 customer service reps. Now they are much larger but I still get the 1-on-1 attention I need from their team.
Very positive experience. They people are great and are providing an excellent service. Cohesity is a forward thinking company looking to stay ahead of the curve and provide that best data experience.
