This product is worth trying . 
Overall, my experience has been very good.  Their customer service is excellent and they really do care about their clients. Even though I have a few frustrations, I know that someday they will be able to accommodate me.  In the meantime I still can get the information that I need, just a little extra time needed.
My AR and AP experience has been turned in to a good, logical, and easy to understand one.
Fabulous customer service. A really great product for mid-sized construction companies
Excellent!
