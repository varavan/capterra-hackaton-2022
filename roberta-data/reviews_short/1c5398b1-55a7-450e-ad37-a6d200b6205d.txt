Our overall experience has been great, again I wish their was a better "learning" center online for the software.
With only 4 suites it is cost effective and user friendly......can't ask for more
Overall experience had been very positive. Any hurdle or questions are always addressed within hours.
My relationship has been great.  They are very responsive and open to enhancements and suggestions.  The system constantly improving and having more functionality 
Very happy with Reservationkey, great solution for our hotel, easy to use and learn und great owner reports.
