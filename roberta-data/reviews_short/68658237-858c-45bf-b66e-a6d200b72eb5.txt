Is been a great experience, easy to pay rent plus also never miss or forget a rent payment 
I would definitely recommend TrueRent. It makes leasing much easier for mangement and residents. 
It keeps everything organized for you. 
I am taking on managing my properties and needed an easy to use system to be able to track my rental properties.  
I have operated a property management company for several years. I also have my own rental properties.  I've only used TrueRent a short while, but so far it's been easy to use and allows me to manage all units, both personal and managed units on one site.  It has everything I would want from this type of program.  Transaction and data entry is easy and can be done from many areas/screens.  This will definitely make my accounting easier.  The "Snapshot" feature is helpful too, I can finally see where I financially stand. The analytics seem very complete with everything I would possibly need to know for forecasting and decision-making.  I can see the possibility of this real time data helping my bottom line.  I will continue using this product and will refer to it often during tax time.
