It's a useful and easy software that my employees have told me time and time again they enjoy greatly for its ease of use. The creation of assignments and tests are great additions to the already vast amount of useful features.
I work in a 24h/7 days operational call center in  Montreal, Quebec that specialize in messaging services.  I am in charge of training and coaching agents on more than 700 different accounts and since I cannot be on site all the time, I use LearnUpon to do a big part of my training.  I am able to put videos, tests and documents for my coworkers.  We also use the surveys which allow the management and myself to have feedback from our coworkers and obtain answers to general questions.  Learn Upon is easy to use even for someone not really tech savvy and whose first language is not English.  I get a lot of positive comments from my colleagues and Learn Upon is used daily.
Because our company works remotely from one another, it's been great to use an easy system like LearnUpon that doesn't require us to all be in the same room. Also because we're building and selling fast, I'm grateful that it's easy to use and easy to edit content! 
LearnUpon has been our LMS for the past two years.  There are many LMS choices on the market and deciding which system to select is never easy, but we simply couldn't have made a better choice when we selected LearnUpon.  Navigating in the system is intuitive at all levels (student, instructor, and administrator).  The system is reliable, flexible, and convenient .... and the LearnUpon staff delivers the highest quality of support and service!  LearnUpon designs their courses and delivers service to ensure their customers' success.  You simply couldn't ask for a better LMS partner and product!
