We tried to implement it 2 years ago at my company but it never worked out for the reason stated above. We use Procore now.
Overall, i love it. It can take your whole office filing and model drawing to the cloud allowing you to work remotely. To me cloud based modelling is perfect, and I don't even pick up hassles working on a 350mb model from home with only a 5mb line. It handles it effortlessly.
So far I have like my experience with the software,  I like when I pick up a job that is using 
BIM 360 and hope more BIM Coordinations pick it up and start using it.
Outside of a few limitations the product works great! I look forward to updated versions. I think with a few minor adjustment this will be a product used by every company 
BIM360 allows us to communicate every issue with trades.   This allows us to monitor and fix clashes to reduce costs on the field.
