This was easy to transition to. I really enjoy discovering new things through the app, especially during this time. 
Whatever you do, do not use virtuagym. Make sure you do your research to see that you are working with a company you like and that it is reasonably priced! My experience with this company was HORRIBLE! FOR THE RECORD: the people I dealt with were Bal Ramirez, Sid Mendonca, and Kalen Pino. At least that is the names they go by for work, who knows what its true! I initially inquired about their software through the internet. I didnt hear anything right away, but for the next 3 days I was harassed with phones calls, to which I didn't answer as I have what you call a "Job". Being that I was unavailable and not answering they decided to call me restricted! RESTRICTED! I answered because of other family circumstances and it turns out to be Bal Ramirez, What a piece of Crap way to force someone to talk to you. Anyways I told him I was not available to talk and that I am too busy, when I have the time is get back to them. Well that still didn't stop the phone calls so I just ignored them after that point. When I finally had some free time I inquired on their software. I sent Bal an email and it went even further south from there. I did a demo with Bal and he told me that it would cost me $199.00 to get set up and $97.00 a month after that point(which I found a way better program to go with instead of this junk of a company...DO YOUR RESEARCH). This made my starting payment $296.00 for just 20 clients a month...how ridiculous...anyways so I sign up and I'm told I will receive a call that day(Thursday). However I never received a call that day or the next day. In fact, I was forced to reach out to them and explain I don't have time for this and to just give me my money back. After being upset with them and their services I have found my self fighting to get every penny back. After they breached their own contract by not calling me, they tried telling me that they know what is best for my business and that there is still a way for them to fix the issue. I responded and let them know that there is absolutely no way I would want to work with a company who cares so little about people and more about the money. I explained that its not worth the risk for me to let my business suffer due to their inability to follow through on their own word. Virtuagym lacks integrity, forth rightness, and several other qualities that you would want you business to be known for. I could not get into an agreement with this company knowing if something went wrong, they wouldnt be there.
