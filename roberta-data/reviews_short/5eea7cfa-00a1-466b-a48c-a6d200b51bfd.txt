Events have been fairly easy to set up and use over the years.  I normally don't have time to go out and watch videos to help me further.  
I appreciate the ease of RSVP setups for events.
It's been a big deal for our small Chamber of Commerce to have such a robust software platform to manage all our events, memberships  and activities. We've contacted customer support so many times - and each time they have been very responsive to our needs. 
This will save me time and be able to focus more on getting new members
