We did research to find the right fit for our small property management company.  Lodgix was exactly what we needed.  Easy to use, staff personally talked to us about our concerns and were very responsive to any questions we had.  It is very reasonably priced compared to competitors.
O preço é realmente justo, não tenho do que reclamar, continuem assim. Parabéns
Raised to be cautious, I spent months searching for the right software to organize my small but growing property management and vacation rental business.  I was hung up on wanting a system that is not online, but after speaking with Brent at Lodgix, I realized the major benefits of an online system in general.  I signed up for three free trials at different companies and found that Lodgix is the best with regards to innovation and ease of use.  The thoroughness and speed of receiving an answer to any question I could come up with also sold me on Lodgix - and most of the responses come from the owner himself!
If you are in the market for an online platform to increase your ease of bookings, quickly create detailed owner statements, organize clients and vendors and save you countless hours of manual email responses to inquiries, then Lodgix will not disappoint!  
Dependable:  I can't think of a single time the system went down other than planned maintenance.  This is key.  It integrates very well with WordPress so our website is meaningful.  It integrates well with VRBO so our main marketing resources work well.  The price just right and scales when we grow
We are new to the vacation rental business.  I chose lodgix after using the free trial.  It is easy to use and integrates great with VRBO and TripAdvisor.  It has saved us a lot of time and leg work.  We use the damage protection coverage also.  It is really a great deal for the money.  No having to collect deposits and do refunds.  I've only had to use customer service on a couple of occasions, but they have been very responsive and great both times!
