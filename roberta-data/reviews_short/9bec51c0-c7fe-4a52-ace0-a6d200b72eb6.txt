My overall experience with Typeform was fun and interactive really loved the program.
Easy to set up, allowed us to have a professional forms on the frontend without having to write custom code
Much better than other options on the market, this is what happens when the product is unique to a function. It is a much-needed tool for communication professionals who need to communicate, disclose, or collect information.
