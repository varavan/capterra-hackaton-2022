My experience has been pretty great with this service. I have not had many problems with it, and even when I would Joe was just a phone call away and he has helped me.
The customer service representatives and technical support team are very responsive to questions, problems or any infrequent glitches with the software.  They offer suggestions and go out of their way to ensure a good customer experience.
