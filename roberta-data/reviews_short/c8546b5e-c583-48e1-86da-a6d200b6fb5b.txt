It was wonderful. I was worried about creating a site and linking it to an EHR. The web developers were highly responsive and answered all questions I had. The developers along with my account manager made a stressful process much easier. 
The ease of use is wonderful! The biopsychosocial is a bit longer than what I need, especially in the area of assessing drug and alcohol issues.  The only other problem occurs when I generate a Interpretive Summary as all of the information runs together, and it has a lot of grammatical/punctuating problems when it is generated that needs fixed manually.  Otherwise, everything else is great and I would definitely recommend this EMR!
Ease-of-use and convenience are the top benefits of Therasoft. Support is responsive to issues.
My experience with Therasoft has been excellent. The scheduling, medical records and billing components are reliable, meet the requirements of my payors and are easy to use. I am thrilled this year to have collected more in revenue, despite taking a month sabbatical. This outcome I believe, is solely due to the hard work of my biller with Therasoft who stays on top of my claims, denials and deductibles. It gives me peace of mind to know that the Therasoft team is coordinating my billing.
