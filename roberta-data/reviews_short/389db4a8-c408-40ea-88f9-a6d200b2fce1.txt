Early review, as I have just purchased the website. I have used the free trial for a couple of weeks, and the interface is good. Anything you might struggle with, had a video to walk you through all the steps. 
Will be launching my new site in the next month, and hopefully working with Brilliant Directories for a long time to come. 
good
the product seems to be a fit to my project. It was a great experince dealing with Marco he was very profesional and had answers to all my questions
Set up is quick and easy, and everything is all laid out for you.
