Overall it has been a great experience. Their support is always helpful and timely, they rarely have service disruptions (despite a massive increase in e-learning following COVID) and they have continued to improve the features of the product.
This software allows for rapid eLearning and content delivery. Its exactly what our company needs to facilitate a quick on-boarding process and keeping our providers up-to-date with the latest software changes, tips, and tricks. Its invaluable as a learning tool and I wouldn't be able to do my job with it.
Pros: excellent reporting feature, linear and logical work flows, great customization, professional looking courses
Cons: course designing options are kind of limited
