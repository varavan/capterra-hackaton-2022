We save a lot of time by not having to manually check devices as Automate does all the reporting for us.
So far it has allowed my company to gain a level of control over our managed machine that we did not have before. Iâ€™m pretty happy with it and support is very attentive, besides the fact of them having a lot of useful information on theirs website.
We have been satisfied with ConnetWise Automate. It brings value by saving time and decrease the chances of outages.
