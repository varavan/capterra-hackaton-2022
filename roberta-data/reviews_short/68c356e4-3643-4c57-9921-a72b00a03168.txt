VERY GOOD ESPECIALLY CUSTOMER SERVICE  WHEN I NEEDED HELP WITH SETTING UP ANOTHER PROPERTY
Not bad (for the price), but after 6 months i changed channel manager.
I have been using Smoobu for over 8 months now and our entire family is very happy to be able to use it. We all use it pretty much daily to mainly accept reservations and coordinate check-ins and check-outs.
