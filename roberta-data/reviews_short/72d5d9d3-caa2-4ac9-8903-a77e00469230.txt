Overall, we have been very happy with our switch over to FE. There was a learning curve when we first started the software and it took us a while to learn all the features and options, but once we got the hang of it, FE seems to really help our business become more efficient and productive. Our customer service manager has been very helpful with all of our questions and assisting in any issues we have. She is very responsive and knowledgable. 
FieldEdge has been a great program for us. the program is easy to use and our Rep. [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] is so quick on responding to our needs. we researched 2-3 top software companies specific to our industry (HVAC & PLUMBING) and after our research, it was an outstanding pick and we didn't go wrong.
Doug was very patient and helpful, because I am not the swiftest.  He walked us through everything we had to do for the update.  He also helped me get my mobile unit running.  He was very helpful. 
My background is in using SAP and after working with this software, it is a pleasure. Easy to use, easy to learn. Excellent Customer Support!
