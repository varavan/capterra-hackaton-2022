I really like this software, it was absolutely useful.
Over-all experience as per my requirements is good and doing my work done easily and fast.
It is perfect for drawing projects, has a wide range of templates that make it easier for you to work and all the types of diagrams you need (at least it is for my IT area), it has a desktop and online version that allows you to work in any place, it is very useful.
