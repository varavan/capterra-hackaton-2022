Overall, I really love Lighthouse Studio! I appreciate the application for what it does for me.
I've been using their survey software since 2001 and I would not consider using another survey software platform.
We use Lighthouse Studio to work on joint projects with many internal corporate clients, primarily, our Strategic Planning team as an input for demand / market sizing. It enables us to test a wide variety of concepts efficiently and rigorously.
