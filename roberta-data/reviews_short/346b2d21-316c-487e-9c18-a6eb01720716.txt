Our IT unit became in disarray when I took over and Solarwinds helped us get manipulate of all elements of systems control. From tracking servers to patching workstations and shielding our users from CTD's. And on top of all of it... Inventory. We now recognise wherein all our property are and who is the use of them.
SolarWinds has a great solutions and been happy with the support.  They give generous discounts and allow very attractive solutions to provide more features and products to our clients.  Its a new solution, so they have issues, but they do seem to take care of them rapidly.  If something does not seem to work for us they will discount it, and allow us to integrate it slowly.  The price is attractive and a consideration for anyone in the MSP RMM or MSSP business.  
Very good. Ease of use. 
Es super bueno y recomendable ya que puedes tener actualizaciones  de ventanas y sobre todo me gusta la seguridad y eficacia del software lo recomiendo a ojos cerrado
