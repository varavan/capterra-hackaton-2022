the system works but needs attention and customer service quick help and help online, to fix over a chat on the cmms system 
it gets easier the more you use the program. at first I wasn't sure but it the directions help they are pretty easy to understand
user friendly easy to use software with plenty of punch. Once your factory Machine Database is loaded then its ease of operation for Works Orders  and tracking history for Corrective Maintenance to reference ongoing issues. All I would ever need for my Plant instead of one of the many more expensive options. Even lets me capture PM's in the form of Hours for our onsite compressors and their servicing shedules.
This software works great for my company.  Love the ease and ease of organization of the program.  I like when one of my employees add a to do it notifies all attached to the system.  
I carry out evaluations of different types of software solutions for companies of all sizes and types in the UK. I have recently trialled SS-CMMS and can honestly say that it is a genuine fully featured CMMS in the cloud for an extremely low outlay which could be used by companies wanting a powerful but very cost effective solution
