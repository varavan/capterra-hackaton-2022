Lightspeed is Awful!!! They fraudulently claim to be connected to all suppliers and distributors of pet products. They are not and it should NOT be my job to get them the CONSTANTLY CHANGING information! That is your job as the provider of the service! Yes, I need to give you a list of my suppliers, but you should be the one to get the info from them so they know what kind of coding or format you need it in!!!!! Also if you tell a prospective client that price X is the amount for the service, then that should be the price, period, end of discussion. However, if you need to raise the cost you should at least give them the opportunity to back out BEFORE you charge them!!!!! And if the price is going to change AFTER a TRIAL period( that we were not told was a thing!) you are required by law to tell them beforehand. IF YOU ALL HAD TOLD ME ANY OF THIS, not to mention that I couldn't return the UNUSED (COMPLETELY UNUSED & STILL IN THE DAMN BOXES) EQUIPMENT, that I was told I had to buy from you and couldn't get anywhere else, I WOULD NEVER, EVER consented to purchasing your product!!!!!!
We are very happy overall that we moved forward back in November with Lightspeed. No regrets and very happy we made the switch. Thank you
I manage a portuguese chicken place downtown, and have been in the industry for a long time. I have worked with Veloce, Cluster and other POS systems and can confirm that LIghtSpeed really came into the market with a great product. Not only is it easy to use and aesthetically good, but it also provides great customer service, which in our line of business is very important when troubleshooting. Fast response with great follow ups.
The system is not perfect yet, as reporting is not complete. That being said i raised the issue and got a call back the same day from the Lightspeed team informing me that they were already on top of it! If that's not proper service i don't know what is!
Great job Lightspeed and thank you for making our lives easier!
Since attempting to do business with Lightspeed beginning almost a month ago, I’ve had nothing but trouble!  These folks make tons of promises, explicit and implicit, but have failed at every turn to deliver.  Having suffered through a nightmare of non-existent service, I attempted to cancel my contract on 12/22/2021.  This may be the only fast response anyone provided since the initial request for a demo.  The salesman, Larry Simard, replied and reminded me that we have a contract, but that someone from, “our Customer Success Team” would be reaching out to resolve the issue.  I finally received a response on today, 1/3/2022.  The young lady who emailed said she couldn’t help me, but that she was forwarding my request and “opening a ticket.”  Interestingly, that is exactly what Larry emailed me on the 22nd!  Look for my recommendation at the end.

Here’s a summary of the difficulties that we’ve had so far and the reason that, quite reluctantly, I was forced to choose another POS vendor.

•	I initiated contact with Lightspeed on 12/8/2021 and began to work with Larry Simard.
•	I expressed to him that it was critical that we move quickly.
•	Larry led me to believe the slowest part of the process was the “two or three days” he said approval of the merchant account would take.  
•	I completed the Merchant Account Application on the same Friday that I received it (12/10/21).
•	On the next day, Saturday, Larry emailed me that I needed to complete it.
•	I replied to him, explainin
Overall, it is a good experience. The customer service is suitable and helpful. The system itself is easy to figure out.
