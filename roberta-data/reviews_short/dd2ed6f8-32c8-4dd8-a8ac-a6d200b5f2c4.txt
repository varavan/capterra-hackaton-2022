We really needed a client database, a place where we could keep notes on clients, and also wanted some task capabilities.  ProWorkflow is the best software we found for what we were looking for (and believe me, I tried them ALL!).
The customer support is excellent
It allowed us to organise a complex flow of projects and allows us to get on with our business.
