time saving and ease of use are the best benefits.  once I was up and running very little help is needed.
Glad I switched from Practice Fusion
We use this software in our high-volume dermatology clinic. Having used other EMRs (Nexgen, AdvancedMD, EMA, eClinicalWorks and EPIC) I can definitively say that Chrono is the best. It is easy to customize, easy to use, has the best ipad functionality, excellent customer support, fair pricing and is fast. We invested the time up front to customize the templates to our workflow; this has resulted in very fast and precise documentation that lacks the other 'junk' that EMRs tend to include - our referring doctors appreciate this. I would highly recommend DrChrono. 
I dont have to write anything everything is a click away saving massive time!
