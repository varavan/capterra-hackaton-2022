Some frustrations here and there, but benefits greatly outweighed the issues.  The best thing is that I can sleep at night without waking up wondering about this or that case.  Really has improved my professional life and hugely improved my personal life, because the software really ties up the loose ends.
I was able to organize my company to perform better with specific resources and I got ready-to-use tools that work for me. I also got another billable time. I managed documents, emails better and never missed deadlines. Today I can work from anywhere in the world just using Amicus Attoney at any time I can manage my company through this software I have a time saving and thus I can produce much more.
Overall I like Amicus.  I looked at a number of applications, some less or more costly and settled here after talking with other attorneys who use a number of different applications.  

Amicus helps you become more organized, particularly if you are in a smaller firm environment.   It can also reduce your overhead by reducing the need for staff because of how it integrates information, particularly timekeeping and billing.    
The practice of law at any level is a business.  As such the bottom line must always be considered.  Amicus has saved money for the firm and has also made money for my practice.  It has saved money by being so efficient that I have reduced staff.  I no longer need a file clerk or an assistant to take time to organize my time, calendar, and tasks.  Amicus does all those things automatically.  

Amicus has made money for the firm by automatically and efficiently creating time records and bills.  
It's  the absolute worst part of my job as admin.  I could replace all of it's features we use with an excel sheet. 

To give you an idea, I actually tell my friends how bad this software is -- yes, it's that bad that I actually bring up bad software in social situations.
