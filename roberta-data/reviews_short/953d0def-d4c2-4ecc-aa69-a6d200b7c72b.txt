123FormBuilder is perfect for creating many different types of forms from questionnaires to surveys and more! I’ve never had an issue finding what I needed because they have an endless amount of options to design and brand whatever type of form your business needs! However, there is a learning curve (due to the many different options) so it can be overwhelming, and the outdated look doesn’t help. Also, the price point is a bit high at over $20 a month but if you can afford to pay this then it will definitely have you covered on anything and everything you’ll ever need to create endless beautiful and professional forms

Pros
Customizability, particularly with r
We were struggling with employee engagement a few months back and now we are rolling. Other features like time tracking and workflow are all the best too.
The resources for marking time and organizing training are top notch, I am completely satisfied with the product. My team today is much more engaged and organized. The new custom report editor was also a real help in my work routine.
