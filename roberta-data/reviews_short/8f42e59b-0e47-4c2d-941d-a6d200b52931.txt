The system is reliable, with very very rare and short interruptions usually announced in advance. Any issues we have had were fixed quickly, a few times within a few hours. Improvements are constant, and the developers seek user needs and fill them.

We have been very satisfied with they system and have built our dispatch, job tracking and invoicing arrangements on this system.
This is great software. It has truly helped increase our productivity. It is easy to track jobs now and has decreased the time it takes to collect on a job significantly.
