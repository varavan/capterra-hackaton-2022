Price Gregory’s operational and financial reporting remains a success due to CGC’s continual evolvement and improvements in their ERP system, eCMS.   In addition, their customer support has exceeded expectations, which includes response time, troubleshooting and overall service. 
Our company reviewed every best in class software package before deciding on eCMS by Computer Guidance Corp. Integration in one product across departments was a very important part of our decision. After 4 years living in the system, I would still go back and make the same decision again.  There is always a new product to market that may do something a little better but from an overall value standpoint eCMS has not let us down.
