My Manager accounting reports can not register Rent Deposits as owner income. I am guessing that it was designed for where it is required that deposits are held in an escrow account. We just receive the deposits as income. Deposit returns are an expense. 

My Manager reports having contacting the programming company and got no solution to this and so we get hand made spreadsheets for when any deposit transaction occurs. This needs to be remedied or clarified.
