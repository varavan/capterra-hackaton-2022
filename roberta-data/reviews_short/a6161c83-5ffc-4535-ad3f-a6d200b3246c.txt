We have been using Centerbase for 15 months and love the ability to work from anywhere we can get internet access.  We love being able to enter billing items from our phones and it immediately be available to bill.  We love that the accounting module is built into the software as well.
Centerbase is a Legal Case Management cloud application that provides a Law firm with full matter management of all the details about a case, including the Parties (each with contact screens) the Court, the Filed Case Activity and MOST importantly all the Documents associated with the Matter, in one location (at the Matter).  It is really easy to use and has fantastic Customize-ability.

As a Controller for a new firm, I was apprehensive about the additional task of learning a new software for our law practice. The timekeepers (attorneys) have remarked about the ease of use with Centerbase and my experience has been very positive. The support team at Centerbase are very responsive and helpful. Shout out to Alicia!
It allows me to track my time and create billing records efficiently.  I've been ver pleased with this product.
