PRTG has been a great find for our IT dept. Previously we used upto 3 products to monitor our IT Infrastructure, now we just use PRTG. 
From being able to view AV status, disk, cpu and bandwidth etc, we have true transparency of our whole infrastructure at a glance and also the  GUI in which we know what areas of our network need attention at a quick glance.
For us, the HP NNMI product is the most important network monitor tool we use together.
Cons? None because since I installed it +2 years ago, never stopped working, done every update successfully. Also, amazing interface. Easy to configure and use. Rock solid and top performance, reported at 3% cpu only. And it is free. 
I only have 20 sensors at the moment but there are 100 free. My experience is not much because if I need one more, I just configure it and that's it. Simple and it works. Again, the interface... priceless.
Thank you PRTG.
