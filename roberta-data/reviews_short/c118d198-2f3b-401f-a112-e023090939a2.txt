Saffire gave us the ability to develop a beautiful and professional website and world class ticketing system without a dedicated IT person on staff.  We have a dedicated coach at Saffire that has become a good friend. He is always available to help. Sometimes he just reaches out to check and see how we are doing. We are very happy that we chose Saffire!
In the events industry, you GET to be a customer service guru.  You GET to answer a number of different questions.  You GET to work with a number of different people, groups, organizations, businesses.  The fact that we don't get  a number of questions regarding our ticket sales, is GOLD.  The platform works.  Working with Saffire is like having another member in your office who handles all of that side of the job.  Big fan over in WA.  ( I stole that from [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN].)
Customer support was great and very quick to respond. 
It is a great ticketing platform and they have an amazing team ready to help with any aspect of the ticketing.
There is never a bad experience with SaffireTix. Saffire is always super helpful and hands on when you need them.
