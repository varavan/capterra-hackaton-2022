Eliminated the need to have clients use paper enrollment.  Using carrier connections to transmit enrollment data saves time.
Strong sales team. Weak product at the most critical parts (carrier connections), with very poor customer service. I don’t expect perfection, but I expect prompt service & repairs, which EASE no longer does. EASE charges a lot for a product that hurts brokers. We’re moving our business to a competitor. 
I enjoy using/working with EASE. It makes my job easier with helping our clients and any issues they may have.
Better than most, is popular, and is easy to use in general.
