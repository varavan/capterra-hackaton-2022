I hope to rent with Cozy at all of my future rentals. It makes life so much simpler. 
I ordered goods for Birthday and Christmas. The order was processed very quickly and I received my parcels quickly too. The whole process from ordering to delivery was speedy and I will have some very happy children!
Managing rentals.  While it is easy-to-use, support and payments needs some work.  I would be willing to pay more for better service.

In terms of new features, you should also be able to refund security deposits as well as accept payments.
If tenant screening accounting and mobile app had existed or been better I would have stayed with Cozy.
