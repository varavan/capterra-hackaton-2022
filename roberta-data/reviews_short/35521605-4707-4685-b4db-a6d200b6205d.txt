Easy to learn and common sense location of what I need to find. Updates like tenant easy -pay are great. I like that I can access the site from all my devices
This product is very simple and easy to use. It is great for basic record keeping and is always improving. 
I am learning how to use this product. It is very intuitive and therefore I have not had to contact support yet. The monthly fee for this is really excellent since we are a very small property management company and need to keep our operating costs as low as possible.
Rentec has all of the recording and reporting functions for our property management company and it is a fairly easy program to navigate. The price is right for small and large companies, and is scaled to your needs. I'm happy to have an internet based program, that I can access anywhere, without the expense that most cloud software companies charge.
