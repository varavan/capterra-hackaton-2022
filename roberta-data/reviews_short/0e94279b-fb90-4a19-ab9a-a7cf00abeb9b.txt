It is so nice to have everything in one place and connected.  It has increased our efficiency by automating some processes and integrating with some of our existing software.  Plus, the mobile apps let us have access to it all no matter where our business takes us!!
Lots of customers and I love that I can assist my customers within a matter of minutes with Zoho 
Every thing is at one place to manage well and in a integrated fashion
I used Zoho One to run my small business last year (and another larger business I was part of before that). It's so good I made a video about it here: https://youtu.be/u4zMJBtkJcU.
Zoho One has helped us stay on top of all the things that are important in our business. From managing customers and leads to staying on top of our finances. It has been very useful in streamlining a lot of the processes we had in our company and finding new and meaningful ways to improve upon them in both time and cost.

For certain processes that we weren't really sure about how to do it right (like HR) - it made these things much easier for us and gave us a system to keep all our challenges in sight rather than being overwhelmed by them.
