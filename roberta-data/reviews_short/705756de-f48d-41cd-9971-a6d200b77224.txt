I would *highly* recommend WebRezPro to anyone that owns a hotel or lodging business.
I have been using the program for 4 years and each year I learn a little more about what it can do to save time and make my business more secure.
The software is great. We have a rotational staff and are always training new people on how to use it. Everyone catches on quickly because the software is so naturally intuitive. 
WebRezPro is able to accommodate smaller boutique properties at a reasonable price. We are loving how user friendly it is and the ability to use their booking engine has made life so much easier as well.
