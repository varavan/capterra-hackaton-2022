Sandbox software does it ALL for our preschool!!!  The billing tool is flawless and we  manage staff and  children enrolled with ease.  The software was very easy to train our employees on and has adapted to our facility perfectly.  Above all, the customer service at Sandbox is top-notch!!!!!  Everyone on my administrative team has their own contact person to go to if they run into a problem.  The team at Sandbox is always available and willing to walk us through our issues (usually user-error) and back in business within minutes.  I cannot imagine using any other software to manage our contacts and billing.  Thank YOU Sandbox for being the answer to our preschool management woes. 
So far it has been great.  Ease of use for entering information as well as easy access for teachers and parents.
