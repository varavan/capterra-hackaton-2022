Worst customer service we have ever experienced. Avoids issues, will not refund your bad calls, will give you zero support. Avoid at all costs!! 
They were VERY helpful in assisting us with transporting over our 15 or so numbers.  Since then we've gotten many more numbers, and because of our use-case, they've worked with us and have allowed us more reach than we really should have.  That being said, we're a call center and have calls coming in and going out constantly -- we need far more details in the reporting area than they currently offer.  If they could tighten down this area, I would have given a better rating honestly.  But this also comes from someone who needs statistics to make daily/weekly/monthly decisions internally.
