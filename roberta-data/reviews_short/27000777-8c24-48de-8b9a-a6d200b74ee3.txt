Overall, for a basic and fast dialer this is pretty good and fairly easy to program.  It is very easy to use and inexpensive.  It isn't Windows-based and that's okay for our uses in general.  It's great for a smaller, startup company to keep costs down.  
Reliable call system.
Excellent channel for communication especially arranging sales , marketing , call campaing with less human resources for high volumes of calls and vast numbers of customer data base in a very short , tight working schedule which means a lot for the business -  saving time, money and having the employees efficiency increased , so a sto get involved in other  work related tasks and jobs .
