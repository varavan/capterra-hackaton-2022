Tracking our employees and our customers.
We have been able to go 100% paperless and continue to find efficiencies in our processes, reducing the resources necessary for data management.   Because development has been focused on the new product, the core application often requires lengthy process to achieve results with many stepped procedures like on-boarding.  The disconnect between the core and web based has created some confusion for users.  Customer service and account management has been very receptive and good, support isn't always as useful.
I would not recommend this software for anyone who needs an ATS or CRM or HR software to fill orders and find candidates.
