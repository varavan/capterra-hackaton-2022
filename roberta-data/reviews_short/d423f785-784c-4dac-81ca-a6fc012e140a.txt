It has been a life-saver in that half our visits on any given day may be done remotely.
Doxy.me has been a lifesaver during this pandemic. I've been able to maintain my pre-covid schedule thanks to the seamless transition to virtual appointments. Patients are able to create their own account but it's not required, which means people from all walks of life can use it regardless of their level of commitment or relationship with technology. It's extremely straightforward which means no awkward, time consuming "learning curve". There's no complicated process or app requirement so I find it's extremely user friendly. 

Personally, I really love how we can customize our link and the name we use. It's a small yet greatly appreciated detail that brings some lightheartedness to a situation that may otherwise be stressful. The virtual "waiting room" is another great feature.

 As far as complaints, I think they all boil down to having a low amount of servers, not an actual function or error. I find that regardless of connection strength, calls will freeze or drop at a consistent rate. It's disappointing but not a hindrance as they reconnect easily. It's also reassuring that we can provide direct feedback with each individual call. I do wish we had the ability to switch between cameras. 

Overall, I 100% recommend Doxy.me! It's free, simple, and flexible- making it an easy addition to pretty much everyone's lives, especially during a pandemic. The last thing anyone needs is another source of stress and Doxy.me ensures patient-provider relationships aren't one of them.
