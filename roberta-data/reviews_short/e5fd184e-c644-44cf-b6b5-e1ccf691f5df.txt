Using since 2017,  and unfortunately  2017 & 2018 was worst, due to very poor support  by in-experienced staff.  Very few hands were trained, rest others couldn't come up to the expectations. Before implementation, the requirement should be reviewed and should implement according to the requirements of the customer.
I appreciate Ali Akber services and he corrected the various issues as per the requirement in yr. 2019. He is the only person who re-structured as per my requirements.  Another set back, the supporting person used to be transfered and he couldn't continue further support.   I appreciate Meraj Fatima support, she is highly responsible lady and always did her best to meet the requirements of my co. Till today the VAT report is not working properly, pay roll not been implemented till today.
The trained staff is over busy, not able to concentrate on the support. In my opinion, the staff should have smart training to support and rectify the basic issue of the implementation. If the implementation is not according to the requirements, the entire challenge is on the shoulders of the supporters.
it was a good experience as I used the software for the first time but I never let me feel like that, as it is user friendly with good functionality 
Nice support team and they will connect always with customer
Super , one of the best software which we have used in our experience
