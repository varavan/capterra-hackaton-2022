It truly is an amazing program. I have been looking for 4 years to find something like this and after probably 5-6 trial and errors of other similar, but definitely not as brilliant, programs we found ProcessPlan and we will never look back. There is nothing on the market quite like this and we will be part of ProcessPlan for a very long time! The customer service is outstanding and right there if I need it. Updates and tutorial videos allow me to learn to do new things I didn’t even know I could and then creates a whole new and exciting aspect of it. You change your template and all the process which haven’t gone past that point automatically updates saving me time and effort to go through every open process to update same. 
So far, works at par with our expectation.
Excellent work
I said game changer and mean it. We are a startup in the payroll industry. Learning and organizing all the processes was overwhelming. We tried writing out processes in word and saving to our shared drive. Not good. With process plan, we were quickly able to organize our most important processes, actually learn the processes better by building them out in process plan, and are now confident we can bring on new hires and not worry about trianing them on everything. We highly recommend Process Plan. 
I started using ProcessPlan several months ago when I was about to go on maternity leave. It was very helpful and made delegating my tasks much easier.
