Fulcrum platform is best to collect extensive mobile data in the field. Fulcrum has advantage of simple drag and drop interface to create apps.
Collected data from different industries ranging from engineering to social and economic surveys
This product has really helped a lot in the day to day data capturing in our organization, and we have only just started.
The product was introduced to us at a Avocado farmers day hosted by a customer of yours, 'Allesbeste' in South Africa, they were so happy with fulcrum that they gave a talk about the platform to plus 500 farmers.
Easy to program  forms, flawless communication between office staff and field crews, great to document field procedures/tasks, easy to generate reports by exporting data to Excel, end user friendly, for sure there is room for improvement but good investment. 
I am very happy with the application and will continue to use it for our field data collection needs
