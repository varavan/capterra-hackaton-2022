We have been using Jobsoid for the last 2 years. We do not have a dedicated HR recruitment team but our management are the first hand users of this system. It is a very simple and easy to use tool which has really simplified our recruitment. Have tried quite a few applicant tracking systems in the past but none seemed to offer the batch interview scheduling feature like in Jobsoid. 
It is one of the helping software overall we are happy with the software.
