The initial hurtle of learning the program is relatively easy and the program itself works well once implemented into your workflow.
Overall terrific for the price. The team is awesome. As the platform continues to grow and features are added it will continue to be more effective.
I've used every dialer on the planet. 
I make my living using the telephone to find new business. 
I just tried myphoner for the first time. 
It totally rocks!!!

Pros:

- The import was the easiest and best I've ever seen.
- Set up is a piece of cake. 
- The Skype integration works flawlessly.
- The workflow is easy and straight forward.
- Making configuration changes is easy.
- Exporting list is so easy and they send it to your email so sharing it with clients is effortless. 
- Perhaps the best feature is that you always know where you are with a given list. You know how far through the list you are and how many yes responses you are getting. 
- Super easy to share the workload via team dialing. 

Cons:

Give me a minute, I'll think of one...or not.
For everyone who is running outbound telemarketing campaigns. Simple, powerful and no software installation.
