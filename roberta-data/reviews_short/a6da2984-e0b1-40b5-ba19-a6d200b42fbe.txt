Our team can provide support to our clients around the clock and share drafts with each other, ensuring that all clients receive the attention needed while providing our team with opportunities to collaborate on responses and communication strategies.
It has been helpful for our company to have the ability to sort our emails by market and then assign each email to the appropriate team member.  It is also helpful to be able to see the number of emails in team member inboxes and when they are online, in order to better determine who may need help.  Having the ability to at mention a team member or share a draft with another member of the team is helpful for the company as well.
Everything's okay it's almost perfect except for their customer support. No one's there and you need to wait 4-5 hours before they respond.
