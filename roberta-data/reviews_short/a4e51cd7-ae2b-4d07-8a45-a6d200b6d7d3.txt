My experience with Survey Methods spans over 15 years.  In that time, I have never had an issue.  My applications are key to my business model, not just a study from time to time.  In all these years, I have never had a hiccup with Survey Methods.  That to me is an outstanding record.  This program is flexible, stable and functional.
Conducting a wide range of surveys including employee engagement surveys, customer opinion surveys, IT customer satisfaction surveys, enterprise risk surveys, workplace safety surveys, organizational effectiveness surveys and diversity, equity & inclusion surveys.
Confidence that my non-profit association members receive a "tight" survey. 
Helps me to provide useful feedback to organizations on executive performance and employee engagement. The tool is great; the report creation is cumbersome at best.
