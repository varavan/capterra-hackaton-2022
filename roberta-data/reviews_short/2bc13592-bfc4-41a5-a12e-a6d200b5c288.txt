As we were building a business from thin air (and didn't have much experience or much money) we had a hodge-podge of methods of tracking people, things and numbers including google doc spreadsheets and scraps of paper. We had begun to use some online services for task tracking and CRM. But we weren't thrilled with what we found. 

Right away PayPanther helped us stay neat and organized and communicate professionally with the collectives that we make products for. But the exciting thing about PayPanther is that as the cannabis industry grows by leaps and bounds PayPanther will grow right along with us. Everything we need is right here.
As a solo practitioner, I used numerous software programs to provide the same benefits that PracticePanther offers me now in one package.
I'm overjoyed that I've finally found a legal option that provides what I require without being prohibitively pricey. On the platform, everything works flawlessly.
Overall, I will always use this software as long as I practice law. It is great for the firm.
