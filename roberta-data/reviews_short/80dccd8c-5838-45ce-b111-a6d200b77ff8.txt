I would recommend Widen as a DAM tool, but it is good to have a champion or team dedicated to launching the tool. 
Ease of use is a big factor for us and being able to modify the DAM as needed makes it a program we can use and adapt to the different business units at NVIDIA. The customer service with Widen is a big help whenever I have questions or issues. 
I have worked with Widen for a little over a Year. This was the first Summit that I attended. It was so informational. I learned a lot about how others use the product and how I could be utilizing it in ways my company had not thought of. 

All of the Widen employees were supper helpful and full of information.  
Our agency works with many clients, but only my client uses Widen Collective. I am the envy of the creative team since I can easily find any image I need.
Widen Enterprises really has a grasp on both Digital Asset Management, as well as how to provide great customer service. We have been walked through everything with great care, and had our client representative hold many demos for us to learn how to use the system. Whenever we request new functionality, we always get great response along with fast turnaround times. I would recommend the Widen DAM as a great solution to any companies' digital asset needs. Thank you Widen!
