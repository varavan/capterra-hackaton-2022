I get to sleep at night and I feel good when I go out of town now.  All because I know that we have a full-proof backup and recovery plan.
We were always fighting with our old backup solution but Veeam so far has been trouble free.
I used the trial version for the software, everything works great no complains but I was looking into a DRaaS that would be cloud ready integrated.
Overall, a very positive experience both with the product and the vendor. Vendor staff were really helpful both during proof of concept testing and the initial on boarding phase.
After struggling with Unitrends for several years, I made the switch to Veeam and wish I had done it sooner! I love everything about it and highly recommend it.
