Support is awful.
POS = Peace Of... Sales Killer. Customer service very poor. A lot of "We will get back to you". Bug fixes come too little too late. 
Easy to learn to use and customizable. Was able to self-train and then train others. Was invaluable to the team and use of reports. Made reconciliation a breeze.
