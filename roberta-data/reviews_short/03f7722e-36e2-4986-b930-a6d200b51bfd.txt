The turn around time on requests is excellent. Most of the time they can take care of the issue on the phone with NO turn around at all. 
I am new to the organization and had very little training time with my predecessor.  Calling the team at MemberClicks has given me the support I need to get through the day. Honestly, they are the most patient and knowledgeable team I have ever worked with. The software can handle a lot and is of great value to our association.  
My overall experience has been good!
Jade Parker is a wonderful Product Specialist. She was incredibly helpful and patient. My recommendation: give that girl a raise! :)
