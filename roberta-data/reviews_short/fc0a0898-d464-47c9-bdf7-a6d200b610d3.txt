Ease of registration management and tracking income/headcounts. Ease of managing forms: liability, medical, etc. Saves time.
Regpack is certainly the most intensive online registration software I have yet come across. This allows for a deeper customizable experience. 

There is a pretty steep learning curve and it isn't an easy software to set up without knowing the ins and outs of it. While there are training videos and a knowledge base, it isn't feasible to spend the time needed to figure the software out without some guidance.

Our event (Drone Summit) has some complicated registration options, and it was difficult to get the ball rolling with that. Our account manager set up what she could as the base, but it wasn't much to work with.

This is where I must mention how helpful and patient Andrew Nichols has been in this process! His follow-up training and quick responses to my pleas for help have been extremely helpful. He's taken the reigns to help set our registration up and flesh it out, and because of his knowledge of the inner workings of Regpack, I'm much more confident about launching the registration because of his effort. 

Thank you, Andrew!

Great improvements in our organization and our programming  were made in productivity, efficiency, accuracy of records, communication with customers, billing procedure, and registration efforts.  We also gained knowledge online registration software solutions in general, and are better-educated and more experienced consumers thanks to our work with Regpack.
