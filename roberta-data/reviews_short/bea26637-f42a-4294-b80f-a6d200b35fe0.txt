My unit uses CrashPlan for end user backups.  There are several ways of setting it up.  We use onsite management with cloud storage.  The initial backup takes a while but it can be set to run in the background just like the incremental backups.  We also have it set to take advantage of idle time and increase the resources used when they are not otherwise occupied.  CrashPlan enables the user to do restores or they can be pushed from the administration console.  It also does versioning of the backups which is especially useful  when a user gets ransomware.  Their customer service is amazing though we have had very little reason to contact them.  They are also constantly trying to get in contact to ask what you think and what changes they can make.
For years we've used Carbonite for our business and server backup needs.  It required frequent troubleshooting and complete re-installs which drove us crazy.  We switched to Code42 CrashPlan and the difference was obvious.  It's simpler to install, simpler to configure and it runs reliably without constantly reinstalling.  Recovery of files has always been quick and complete.      
We utilize Crashplan as ransomware insurance and a quick-and-dirty disaster recovery system.  My organization has been hit by floods and hurricanes, and one of my offices is now in a tornado-prone area, so, better safe than sorry.  Crashplan is simple, yet powerful, allowing me to ensure I have multiple backups of all of my important files in case something happens, and I've had to utilize it to restore from a ransomware infestation more than once.  This system is a lifesaver!
