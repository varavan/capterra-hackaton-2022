Over all experience has been good, we used to have issues with operating in offline mode but it seems like that's been taken care of recently. 
Overall Upserve is a decent option for a POS system, but you may want to understand your greatest needs before making the switch.
The set up was smooth, we have had no major issues, and whenever we have needed anything, or had an issue/ question, we have had great response time and had only patient, knowledgeable reps help us.
