No problems and quick service
We are very happy with Applicant Pro at our company. We have tried several ways to accept applications online without any major cost increase. The solutions we came up with were either difficult for the applicant to use, or didn't work with our hiring process. Switching to Applicant Pro allowed us to accept user-friendly applications as well as work with our hiring process. Applicant Pro was also one of the most cost-effective solutions that I researched. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a digital hiring solution.
