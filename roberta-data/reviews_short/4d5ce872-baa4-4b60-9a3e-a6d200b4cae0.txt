My parents love seeing pictures of their studentsâ€™work, captions that document what the student was doing and the fact that it can be saved and shared with them online!  The customer support quickly responds and is very helpful. This is my second year using the program and I have had great results.
We were one of the first users and they have changed and updated many features, based on our feedback, so I really appreciated them listening to us! 
Customer service has been pretty great. When you have an issue, they're pretty quick to respond. They also take suggestions, however you might need to keep suggesting before you actually see it in a new feature... they do communicate very well though! 
Kaymbu is a wonderful solution for communication with our parents.  They do enjoy receiving daily communications.  There are a few kinks that need to be worked out but we know you will all work towards offering good platform.
Parent's are loving seeing what their children are doing throughout the day.  We send pictures and comments daily to our parents.  It also a very quick way to communicate regarding accidents and behavior issues.
