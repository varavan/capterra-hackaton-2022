Customer service is exceptional.  I consider Jive customer service to be the best in any industry.
Greatest value for the software and all it's features (more than I need/use).  I feel confident that it's been very reliable and know if I have any issues...customer service is very prompt and helpful!  I love it!
Jive has been a great solution for our small business. We're able to design & modify the phone tree to suit our needs & record different outgoing messages for different times & boxes. The pricing is lower than our previous solution & we were able to use cordless handsets. It's also pretty convenient to be receiving voicemail via email. Transferring calls is easy.
We had a very poor experience, and we don't be considering it in the future.
Overall not a bad service for being reliable.

Just so you know. I was offered $10 to write this review.
