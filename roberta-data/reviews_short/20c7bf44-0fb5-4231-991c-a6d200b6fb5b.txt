It makes my daily tasks very easy. I've used many programs the past few years and this is definitely my favorite one!
Being able to upload documents to the clients chart is great! We can do away with paper files, as well as being able to email the client forms directly from Therapy notes it looks more professional. The ability to send clients text and email reminders is amazing as well!
