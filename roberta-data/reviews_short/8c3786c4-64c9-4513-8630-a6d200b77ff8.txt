When I first looked for membership software, I rejected Wild Apricot because it looked so simple.  I thought it could not meet all of the needs my associations had.  After struggling for 2 years to train others to use the complex software, I needed to retire as webmaster.  The only way was to find a simpler program.  

I have now used Wild Apricot to set up 3 associations.  I have not found anything it could not do.  I am so happy that is looks simple to new users, because I now have the entire Board taking care of their own parts of the program (membership, conference/workshops, treasurer, newsletter, etc.).  It is easy to assign roles, and people learn their role with little help.


We have been using Wild Apricot for just over a year and found it to fulfil exactly what we wanted at an acceptable cost and it is easy to use. Their customer service is outstanding and they follow up all surveys with responses and suggestions.  
I am the president of a small all volunteer 501-c3 organization that is membership operated. Wild Apricot gives us the ability to keep in contact with our members and all our contacts. We are able to invoice our members for dues, register & collect from donors that participate events and collect direct donations all with the same system. Wild Apricot is constantly updating and adding features that make the software worth the price.
Wild Apricot offers an all-in-one platform: member database, payment mgmt, and event organization. It is easy to learn and easy to setup for every organization's particular needs.
