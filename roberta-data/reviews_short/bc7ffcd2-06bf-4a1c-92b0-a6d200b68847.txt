very happy , I have travelled half way round the world never missing a beat .
Rubbish, only recommend to my enemies!!

Terrible 
It didnt start well as the original sales person made false claims about some of the features, to the point i refused to have any moe contact with them. and slightly blurred pricing on number of licenses will be charged at what point. also it turns out if you leave your data isnt your data. The one good thing was the person who took the training, just a shame it was such a poor software to train on.
