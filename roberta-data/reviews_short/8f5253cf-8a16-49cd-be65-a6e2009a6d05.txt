I am able to provide better, error-free, and more timely communications with my customers while freeing my time to focus on other things.
I wanted to make sure an email went out on a more regular basis and not in between my other work to remember to send out a message.  It took a couple of days to get all my messages set up and once that happened it has been like clockwork them being sent out and my guest feel like I am reaching out.
I love this GMS. 
My company originally had 30 properties and 20 accounts for Airbnb. It was so pain to access each accounts to respond to guests. But GMS changed my working life 50 times easier for sure. The good point is this software is very simple structure and it is easy for anyone to understand it. Secondly, it has been developing every week or every two weeks and getting better and better.   I can always get quick response from customer service when some issues come up.  Sometimes there are issues on the system but it's never become serious issue as they fix it pretty quick. 
They are also happy to listen to your idea to improve GMS so I am very excited about GMS's future.  
iGMS has been a great tool to use, but I only have 3 listings. If I had to pay $20/listing, I feel like it would be too much. I would probably have to try another company such as smartbnb.io or superhosttools. I would love a way to automate email notifications or Whatsapp messages to our cleaning team who is not very Tech-savvy.
Overall, we have been very happy with iGMS.
