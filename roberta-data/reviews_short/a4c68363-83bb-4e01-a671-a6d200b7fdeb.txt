I have used many different accounting systems with inventory. Overall this software shows real potential as an easy to setup and easy to use system. 
We have been using Talech for 2.5 years.  It works pretty well for us.  Have been happy with the improvements.  Main improvements I would like to see is reports with subtotals when downloaded and a more robust quickbooks integration.  As it stands, I am not able to use it.
Spoke to the Telech rep and she was helpful and made me understand of the problem. The only issue I had is that the server went down during the busy hours and I wasn't able to process any credit card transactions. Apparently,  The rep was fully aware of the issue and told me the server went down.
Talech has made it ten times easier to track inventory...that was our number one time killer.
