This software does not deliver the service it advertises. 
Used to be good. In the past 6 months, this app has fell apart. - constant glitches. Can't log in. Customers getting logged out. 
I am very happy to have signed up for this software.  I anticipate using GloFox for the remainder of my career as a yoga studio owner.
Glofox is a wonderful system that has helped me to run my studio in an easy, organised fashion. I was hesitant at the start to change my ways, but a year in, it only gets better. 
Custom branded app was cheap in comparison to others. But I seem to have gotten what I paid for.
