It is an easy software to accurately record and track giving and donor data.  There are modules available for most users regardless of the size of the organization.
Great customer service. The  vendor actually knows my name.
I can't speak to the overall experience, but for donor relations, we're using the modules to tie up some important data points.  For example, tying donor to fund to scholarship recipient will be very powerful for fundraisers who want to solicit for specific scholarship funds.
