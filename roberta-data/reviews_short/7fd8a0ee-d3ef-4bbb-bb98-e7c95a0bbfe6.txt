Airmeet has been wonderful for connecting large audiences for events like vendor showcases, state of the company meetings, and large scale collaboration breakdowns with big name brands. My company hasn't been utilizing Airmeet for long (just started due to the majority of the corporation now working remotely) and I'm looking forward to integrating it even more into our workflow. 
I love how easy it is to sync Airmeet to Eventbrite. It's very simple to sync Eventbrite registrations to an Airmeet. They utilize private tokens so the whole process feels very secure, and all you have to do is click which event you want to connect to Airmeet and you're basically done! In this day & age of virtual meetings & seminars is such a great tool to use to connect seamlessly with a virtual audience, and the ability to create polls, take questions and streamline Q & A is top notch. 
I don't have many complaints, I supposed it would be beneficial to create custom fields for the participants could coem in handy, currently you can only see/add your name, email, company & title. 
Terrible, really don't use
Looks flashy but has a terrible back-end
Half my webinar video was deleted from the recording, customer support not getting back to me
It was fantastic.
Airmeet's virtual event platform is fantastic. It has interesting features such as speed networking, hosting live virtual events, etc.  Their tech support is very competent and supportive.
The platform demands high internet bandwidth especially if you want to play videos, etc. So it's important to do a thorough mock run below the live event.
I see this as an almost perfect solution - it would be lovely to have more options for third-party integration such as interpretation (other than interpret, you should be able to assign your own interpreters). I little bit more freedom to customise and you're there!
Customisable branding and the table-based discussion space is a superb features. It creates an inclusive, dynamic environment for people -mimicking the networking opportunities of in-person events. It's also great that we can stream in to Airmeet, with no issues a at all
One major reason why I use streamyard to stream into Airmeet is the ability to add banners, and images and control the camera view layout for everyone watching. The way that Airmeet squeezes cameras on screen means people's faces are often cut off and there's nothing we can do to resize people in the meeting. The mobile experience is also very poor - should be prioritising an app for mobile users.
Great experience and a great and supportive team to help you to onboard
The virtual tables allow attendees to connect with others (not the case on other webinar platforms)
The possibility as a speaker to see the reactions of the audience thanks to the emojis
As a host, the easiness to add a speaker from the attendance during a session
The possibility to have our virtual office and hold meetings or meet other colleagues anytime
The color of the background (very dark, especially for old screens)
It is an amazing platform that has allowed us a new dimension in implementing and executing virtual meets and events closer to a physical feel (without the need to go VR or game-ified platform), specially when you're dealing with people who appreciate a more straight forward approach
It is so easy to use and highly intuitive for those who are always in a video call or attending a virtual event. I love the fact that break out tables are integrated off the bat. 

The ability to also schedule your speakers, and that it has a virtual green room is also a super big plus. 


Some feedback we got is that the older, more technologically challenged participants had a steeper learning curve. We addressed that by creating a step by step manual, complete with screenshots and what to press, but there are those who are really challenged by technology.

I also wish that there could be consideration for payment integrations for those based in the Philippines like GCASH, PAYMAYA or something similar.
It's great, it's reliable (given that the participants or guests have a good/stable internet connection.
The price point, the ease of use, the beauty of the UI.
At first, it was not possible to sell tickets directly on Airmeet. Since then, they added this features along with other things almost every month.
User Interface is very nice and backstage option is very useful
Its Takes more internet when compared to other products
We use Airmeet for our webinars. The app is sufficient. The chat doesn’t seem to get overloaded as we have experienced using other platforms.
I love the potential of this platform. There is a virtual lounge available and branding options available.
Some tweaks are still needed. The virtual lounge tables allow for images to be added to them, but you really can’t see it when it is being used. 
Great platform to host your virtual event. 
Networking lounge, branding and live sessions
It would be great if can give e-name card while networking. Control guest to seat on the network lounge so that they will need to meet with everyone in the virtual event. 
Good
The actual appeal of a seminar and the outlook of a real event is a good experience. 
Initially we faced some problems with the software like inability to present screen. 
Pleasant. Customer support was very good.
Ease of use. Image resolution is of high quality. Unlike others, more people can participate on the stage
Needs new features like onstage dynamic banner, more mobile friendly
It went well except for the technical issues mentioned
Easy to implement, feels like a physical fair
not possible to keep both chat and auditorium on, not accessible easily through mobile phones
took forever to get my technical issues sorted
See above, it was awful
Nothing, was never able to use it. Waste of
money 
Bought a few licenses of their lifetime deal. Changed the legal name of our company to gain trademark approval, but Airmeet refuses to change the name for mysterious “compliance issues.” So, unless I want to create a branding nightmare, it’s just wasted money. 
# The product is good, but requires a lot of weeks in terms of user experience and should bring mobile version of the product
# Networking feature
# Ask question option
# Require good internet speed to work seamlessly.
# No mobile application or mobile responsive view
Airmeet is very intuitive and visibly attractive product that continues to evolve to be best in class.  The speed networking and round table features are particularly well appreciated by our attendees. They provide a round the clock support service which is very reassuring although have not had much cause to use it.
The Mobile access on some browsers until recently has not been fully supported.
Organizing 2-3 events in a remote world is hectic and worrisome given the engagement and involvement of users is lower. But Airmeet has made our lives easier and several of our attendees have given great reviews about the platform.
Support - Phenomenal team working round the clock with direct access to speak to someone!
Simplicity - Several networking + event platforms have come up in the past year but most of them are built keeping tech-savvy folks in mind. Airmeet is not the easiest platform to use but still better than the rest.
UI/UX can be improved further. Better documentation and YouTube tutorials for first-time users will make it easier for admins.
It's a wonderful way to get the doulas that I train across the country and the globe to get together quarterly. They love the speed networking and the social lounge and the ease of presenting their work. It is helping the community to come together and support one another. It is doing everything that I need.
I love how easy Airmeet is to learn and to use. I don't consider myself to be fabulous with tech, but this makes me feel like a tech genius.


I struggled to easily end an airmeet, but I suppose that's just practice. Finding my way around more.
Overall Airmeet is a great tool. It provides a fresh and different perspective from the conventional virtual meet softwares. Another advantage was that it was quite stable and worked well on a decent bandwidth.
Unlike other software, the interface of Airmeet is quite modern and interactive. It tries re-creating the offline setup of any event virtually. Further, it is easy to navigate through the different features that increases it's utility. 
The software was a bit restrictive with it's structure. I got the opportunity to use it in one of the events and it took some time to get used to.
Excellent 
Easy to use  all features are excellent  very nice application  with great experience 
Most impact full  and I give  you rating  10
