I inherited IconCMO as our ChMS, and could not wait to use another product. While IconCMO had served the congregation well in other era, the ability to be more flexible with data and integrate with more services were very important to us, and we eventually moved to a new solution.
We had been using the Revelations software and was in need of upgrading (ICON was no longer going to
support that very old version), in all honesty, we went to ParishSoft ...we stayed with them for one year and returned to the best software out there.
IconCMO is employed successfully both at the church I attend as well as a non-profit environmental activism organization.
IconCMO is the primary accounting system for the Church. Spirit of Joy is a small congregation church, but IconCMO gives the church the benefit of a large church accounting at an affordable price. IconCMO has a large repertoire of reports.
