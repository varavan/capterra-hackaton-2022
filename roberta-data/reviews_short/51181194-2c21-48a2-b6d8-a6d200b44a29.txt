We upgraded our very archaic membership database system to GymMaster well over a year ago now and have never looked back. Initially we only started with GymMaster software as we had our own access control in place, however overtime we moved to GymMasters gatekeeper system to harness the full potential of the GyMaster management system. It is this ability to customize the GymMaster package to our needs that I love. 

Pros: Fantastic support team and system that can fix almost anything, easy to use software that all staff have no trouble operating, full member door/gate access control that we can customize, software that is continuously evolving and the price is very affordable.    

Cons: None.
A business partnership with the customers interests at heart. We are all human and mistakes are made but I really appreciate a supplier who you can talk to and who love their product enough to change it to meet a customers needs. Other competitive products on the market have you talking to hourly rate call centre support or sales staff and there is an empty feeling of not being heard. You are always heard at GymMaster and they genuinely try and help, every time.
You can't beat the customer support they are quick and always take care of any questions I have. With the intrigated  texting and e-mails to the customers  communication is quick.  I was  researching new software for a few years for the gym when I came across theirs at IHRSA it did everything I wanted and more.  Just got the gymmaster app on the phone a real neat feature. The software makes the gym run smoother  and efficient with better control of the gym.
