We used to publish our own website with conference info; it had the basic info, but it was hard to keep the pieces consistent.  Now we link to the Sched site from our event page and attendees find everything there.  Speakers can post their pix and handouts and complete/update their profiles and send e-mail blasts to all who signed up for their workshop.  We got good reporting and from it (and Google Analytics) see a high engagement rate (not just page views; over half set up accounts and created a personal schedule).  This is all from their lowest service level/tier; higher levels integrate more with registration/payment etc., but we already have an online store and used it for front-end registration.

We are building momentum for professional development by keeping Sched as the “look” of our event for the past three years. 
Fantastic!
The folks are great!  So responsive when I need help, and have a great sense of humor.  They keep things fun :D 
Communication is the main problem that Sched solves. It's an at-a-glance snapshot of an entire evening that easily drills down into specifics. It invites interaction, so that's another communication problem solved/helped. I couldn't be more thrilled to have Sched working on my event's behalf. Thank you!
