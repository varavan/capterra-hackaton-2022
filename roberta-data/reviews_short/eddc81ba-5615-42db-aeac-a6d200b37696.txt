My company has had a great experience with Datto Remote Management. 
The local backups are very reliable, they do offsite in a way that support can retrieve your data when needed, and the company if very polite and friendly, and will gladly explain why the part you need doesn't work.
Our main purpose in using this class of software is to get cloud backup as easily as possible with a product that comes with solid support.  Datto seems to have achieved those goals.
I've used the Datto Siris for years now and been extremely happy with its day to day performance and when used in anger.  Support from Datto is also excellent.
