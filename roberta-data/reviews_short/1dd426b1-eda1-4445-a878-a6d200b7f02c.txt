the log in time is awful, it takes anywhere from 10-15 minutes for my computer to boot up, run systems and then launch a browser before I can log in. This means that not only do I have to get here that much earlier but I am not getting paid for 65 hours a year, costing me over $1000 and making me look late every day which is noted on my performance review.
Tammy has been working with Plan Group for over a year getting this software up and ready to go for our users. Delay was on our end not TOM's. Tammy has always been reliable and extremely quick to respond to any questions we may have. 

We have received nothing but positive feedback from our employees about TOM. It is so quick and painless to submit and approve a request. 
Great overall experience, would recommend 9/10 times depending on your specific use cases. 

We have a tiered PTO system that was not supported by many PTO vendors that I looked at but when I got it to work in TOM, I was sold.  I appreciated the free trial because it gave me time to see how it benefited my company.   Also, I have had no complaints from employees regarding the use of TOM which is a huge plus.  Overall, my company is extremely pleased with TOM and how it manages our time off policy effectively.
