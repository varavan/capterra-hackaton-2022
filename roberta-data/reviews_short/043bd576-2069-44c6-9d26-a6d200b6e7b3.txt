My overall experience with teachable was good it just did not fit my needs. 
I wish I had signed up for the free or lower-cost plan first.  It's very difficult to switch platforms, so this is a decision that requires a lot of pre-purchase diligence.  I now use Systeme.io, which offers way more features at a fraction of the price.
Overall, my experience has been great! Their customer service team is super helpful when you need them and the platform is very familiar to a lot of other bloggers and online business owners. 
I love the webinars; they keep me motivated.  You won't receive as much one on one unless you choose the more expensive platform.
My overall experience is great!! I love it !
