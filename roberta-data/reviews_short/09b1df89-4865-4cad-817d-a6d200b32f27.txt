I found these folks while researching a CRM system for a childcare client. The CRMs I had used in the past were just too bulky and required too much customization to be reasonable; so when I found Childcare CRM, I almost couldn't believe what I was looking at. They've thought of everything - and any little thing that may be "missing" is being developed. It's just fantastic.

Our salesperson, Emily, has gone above and beyond - answering every little question and following up with center directors. The tech support is fantastic, as well. I've found that a lot of services such as this leave you feeling lost in the wind - I actually feel supported here. 

Again - fantastic product, great team, stop looking - this is the CRM you want if you're in education or childcare.

Experience using  the program has been efficient and easy!
Although I was very excited to have this software - my google spreadsheets seemed easier to use. They difficulty and clutter of the tasks and different explanations of stages made it extremely hard to navigate. The software was supposed (and advertised) to be compatible with the parent communication app we used - but unfortunately, the flaws in the system made it impossible to connect the two.
