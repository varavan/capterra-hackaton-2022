A change. 
I have had a good experience with hot schedules and will keep using it for my work schedules. I think it could improve but it is a solid work scheduling option.
It's been the easiest scheduling program I've worked with.
For any size team, this is a must-have scheduling app. Everyone on staff, from executives to employees, uses it every day, on a regular basis. I would recommend it to any business owner because it saves time by providing a variety of functions.
Overall the app makes check my schedule, releasing shifts, swaps, and messaging staff a lot more easy and sufficient. Unfortunately I hate the it cost $3. Make a long story short, I had the app when I had an android. Got a new phone(apple) and I had to re pay for the app because my phone was linked to a different email. Pretty annoyed about that. I like the fact that I could still use hot schedules online if you don't pay for the app. But the online website isn't as easy to use as the app (or I've just been so used to the app). So I re bought it.
