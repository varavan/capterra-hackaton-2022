The customer service as always been exceptional.  Any problem we have encountered has always been fixed in a reasonable time frame.  Their support staff are very knowledgeable and easy to work with.  Easy to get a hold off.
We were stuck using our antiquated shop system and dreaded having to switch to a new platform. We really liked all of the features E2 Shop had to offer and the transition to their service was smooth and trouble-free. We highly recommend their solutions!
We have been a customer of E2 for over 15 years.  In that time we have learned about the functionality of the system, as well as made adjustments to our system to ensure that we enter the best possible data to get out the best possible data.  E2 is flexible, easy to use and a good choice for both a Job Shop and Plastic Injection Facility.

But on the other hand the E2 Shop System is very good and helps me a lot in my researches and that's why I recommend it.
