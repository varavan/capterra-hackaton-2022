We searched for a number of years for a simple system which ticked our boxes and was affordable, Ive used big systems in the past that were expensive but did a great job, Statii is an inexpensive system which certainly does as good a job, the chaps were more than helpful at all times and the support has been spot on. We are about 6 weeks in to using it now, the training we have needed is minimal (and was always available) and its become our new daily best friend in all ways, we use the tablet option for the lads on the shop floor which is still new but the potential for real time data is already showing its worth.
As a "cloud-based" MRP software, the application is very responsive.  The screens are optimized to load quickly and you can have multiple tabs open at the same time to go from one module to another.  The support from Statii has been outstanding.  Very responsive and the trainers/support staff are very knowledgeable of the software and how to implement within our business 
I find the team very helpful, proactive with problem solving and its cost is affordable.
