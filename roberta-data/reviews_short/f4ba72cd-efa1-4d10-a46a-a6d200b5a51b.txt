In my day-to-day life, PDFElement is a unique tool.

Manipulating PDF documents with it is very simple.

Creating a PDF document, editing, protecting and emailing it is so simple and functional that it doesn't even seem like the program is free.

Its modern and attractive look, combined with the many excellent functions it has, make PDFElement the best PDF reader on the market.
Recently, I used this software to edit an existing PDF ebook to include links to authoritative websites. Just felt the existing PDF was lacking in good resource and reference material and wanted to add a useful component to the file. Then I offered the PDF for download on my site. My site visitors have really raved over this PDF file that I was able to create. Very good to know this type of software is available as it gives me many options for editing a PDF file. I can only imagine how I will use it next.
