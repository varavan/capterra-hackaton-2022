I have not worked with the Proshop type application within Iclass but would love to look at it and see if it is useful for us. 

Also, I would like to be able to choose "make up tokens" by a start to end date (as our "sessions" typically run 2 or 3 months. 
Great customer service
We have loved all that it has to offer. We have been with 3 other companies in the past and this is by far the best priced, and has the greatest features! Trust me when I say I scout out all the time and have yet to find something as good as or better. These guys are the best in the business and we have been very happy with them every step of the way!
