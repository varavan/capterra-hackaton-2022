Using this software since i discovered it, so helpful and easy to use and learn it just may need some time to get used to it. 
Confluence is good at sharing information with customers and procedures to resolve a specific problem. Easy to work with the support team. 
We use confluence for collaborative multi-editing documentation 
- It was a clean and neat interface and features integrated for conflict management and multi-user editing
- the pre-defined templates are great 
- good overall user experience
