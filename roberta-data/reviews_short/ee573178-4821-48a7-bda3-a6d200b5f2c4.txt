Utterly disappointed
Our employees and customers have all liked using PureChat to communicate.  It's very easy to use and allows us to answer our customers' questions almost instantly.  Using PureChat helps us feel more in touch with our customers.
Just an A+ software. Improves external communication immensely.
Overall, with some improvements and added features and functions, this could be one of the best softwares available in the market. 
Love it, Love it.  Buy this software it is so helpful and your team sees the information they need with their own widget for that specific department.
