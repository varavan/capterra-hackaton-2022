Overall, Weave is a great product.  I do believe that they will be adding features, and upgrading their platform as time goes on.  I would recommend them to my dental colleagues.  It is really nice that a patients name and info pops up when they call.  I really like to communicate with my patients, and this is the way to do that.  I also like their digital fax that they provide.
It is great. We had outdated phones. We got new phones and modernized our telecommunications with ease.
Set up was a challenge and I spent many hours daily on hold or in a Que waiting for someone to trouble shoot. Took a couple of months to get that accomplished but things have been fairly smooth since then. 
Overall I am happy with Weave's text and chat messaging, along with the ease of faxes. The phone system has worked well too.
The support is very good
