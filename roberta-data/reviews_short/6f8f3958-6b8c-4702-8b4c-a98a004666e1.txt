Very happy with it.
I have used this software for almst every section of my business and found it to deliver a high number of responses with good applicants. 
Very happy with WizeHire. Have recommended to colleagues and will continue to use as needs arise.
I have used several software companies in the last few years, and I have to say that WizeHire is the absolute best out there.  Customer service is superb, and we have found some excellent quality candidates with the help of WizeHire.  I do believe we will be forever clients.  
While Wizehire is on the cheaper side... I feel like it shows in limiting options. I also experienced resumes not being received because of a server error.  Never ended up getting those resumes as people were asked to reapply and did not.
