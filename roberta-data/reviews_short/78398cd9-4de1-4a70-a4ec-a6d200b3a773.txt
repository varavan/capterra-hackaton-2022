If this is your only option it will serve its purpose, but it is a frustrating experience with limited capabilities for Mac users and if you are like me, and work in creative fields than that just doesn't work. There is better software such as Planning Center Online, that are much more efficient. 
We have had a very enjoyable experience with the database. It has allowed for us to streamline our budget by eliminating duplicate services. It has also given us a tool to track attendance and become more engaged in retention efforts. 
happy with the product. easy to use. I like that can be customized to work for us. 
PLEASE UNDERSTAND ELEXIO's RATINGS ARE SKEWED... Most of the the positive reviews on this site predate Elexio's switch from a server-based to cloud-based solution, and you will notice that the more recent reviews that have a tendency to critique to platform are mysteriously devoid of an Elexio Teams that you find paired with most of the earlier posts.

At first the Elexio software was promising, offering a rich financial reporting option with the most robust ChMS we could find, but their support promises proved to be hollow and after being convinced by their team that the cloud-based Elexio Community (which we were virtually forced to embrace) would be a better solution only to find that it has massively added to our staff's workload, I would not recommend this to anyone. I cannot imagine being put in a worse situation by a software designer.
