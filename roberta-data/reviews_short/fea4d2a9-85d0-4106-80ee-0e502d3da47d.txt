The new website builder from GoDaddy boasts high uptime, attractive templates, and ample storage and monthly data transfers. However, it does not provide much in the way of page design customization.
I have been with GoDaddy for many years and they are always 
Improving my experience.
As one who builds websites for small business clients, I have found GoDaddy's domains and services easy to purchase. I know if I have a problem the Customer Service is awful so I have to youtube it. If they fix the glitched and security. I will tell everyone about GoDaddy.
