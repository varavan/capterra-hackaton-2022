My job bought this software to help speed up the amount of correspondence that comes through my office, since I have to log everything that comes in/goes out, in addition to checking every piece for quality assurance.  The logging part was very time-consuming, so like I said, when this works (quickly), it's a decent program.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work quickly very often.
I have a database for all my stock with a history. Previously we have been the usage of Excel to music and manipulate over 4000 portions of gear and it was once now not a sensible device for that. Gigatrak has streamlined our property administration system and supplied us with a great deal greater dependable data.
No more lost or misplaced tools! I have it set-up so the tools are signed out to a certain instructor, this puts the responsibility on to them to make sure that their students return the borrowed tools at the end of each day.
