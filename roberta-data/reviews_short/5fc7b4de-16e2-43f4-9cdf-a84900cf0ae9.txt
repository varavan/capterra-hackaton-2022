The customer service is very good. 

The ability to grow our startup to a global level with low financial burden.

 With CS-Cart, we were easily able to create a site like amazon Without spending countless  hours and testing, we were able to list our SKUs in the correct format to start our products. We were able to focus on the businezz instead of setting up a site on daily basis. It has helped our business tremendously in saving time and money.
It's easy to manage vendors. To be able to offer different alternatives to users in a specific plan. To be able to offer the same product with different vendors. And many features like this
after trying several solution such as opencart, shopify, woocommerce and magento i found that CS-Cart Multivendor version meet all my need and provide me with every solution i needed ( from easy installation , easy editing and use to customer and vendor management and plans )
