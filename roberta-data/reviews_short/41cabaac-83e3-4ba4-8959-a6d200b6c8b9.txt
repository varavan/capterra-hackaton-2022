If there is a problem, the support is very good. 
It's an incredibly useful tool, as a middleweight designer, for logging hours, cuing hours for team members, and quoting for jobs.
As a team member it helped me in tracking the time spend on each project so that I could keep a track of my weekly hours. Helped in evaluating and improve efficiency 
Excellent, they are very helpful and attentive to my needs!
