It's hard to argue with a great program.  It's among the best I've ever used.  Great programming and interface.  
WhenToWork has streamlined the scheduling process and made it MUCH easier on the employees.  Less "I didn't know my schedule" issues after implementation of this product. 
Pretty positive, very user-friendly and though it doesn't have a ton of extra features it does exactly what we need it to do.
