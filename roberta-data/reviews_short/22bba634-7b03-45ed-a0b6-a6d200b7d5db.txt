I am extremely satisfies with the customer service, from Jimmy Doorenweerd who introduced Hostaway to me and helped me transition from the previous Property Manager, to Celeste, my account manager who helped me onboard all the channels, understand and use the system, and who is always available. Without forgetting Celeste's team, Amanda, Gabriele and Goncalo who I interact with quite often, who are very helpful as well. Finally, the product team is ding a great job implementing new features quite regularly. 
We originally signed up with them in August and at the time their on boarding wasn't great. We went to another company for 5 months and regretted moving away from HostAway ever since. We recently signed back with HostAway and our experience has been amazing. [SENSITIVE CONTENT], our onboarding specialist, has been amazing at helping us navigate through the features of the software.
Customer support was very helpful, however i do wish i there were more available time slots so i didn't have to wait so long between meetings.
I have tried a lot of channel managers but Hostaway is the one with most and easy characteristics. If setup correctly, everything is automated!
Overall our experience with HostAway is good. We like the team and the way they listen to our feedback. Also as mentioned their support is quick to follow up to our tickets which makes working with the product pleasant.
We really benefit using HostAway for our daily operations... It works for 80% of our needs.
