Better tracking of costs to time and jobs. Very easy to use the scheduler to assign jobs and see where everyone is at on any given day
It's amazing how after the initial set up you rely so much on the software that makes everything absolutely simple ! 
Everything is there for you ! 
Could use an add materials from mobile feature instead of computer but it works amamzingky for myself! I have so much time after a few words on tradify and no longer worry about losing my phone or some paperwork because you can just pick up another and pick up where you left off.
So far our experience with Tradify has been positive.  We run a small plumbing company and use this app to track our jobs from start to finish.  It links up with our accounting system which is great.  When we have provided feedback to Tradify on improvements, they have always responded and most of these have been included in the latest software update.  It's good to know they are constantly looking to improve the software for the end users (us).  When ever we have had a question regarding how to do something in Tradify (which isn't often, as it is very user friendly), their customer service has responded in a very timely manner.
I find the online support staff extremely helpful, always there to answer any problems.
However i feel there are too many small problems with tradify, from jobs disappearing to pages being completely blank until there refreshed, boys not getting messages. When i hover an arrow over the jobs to see the summary, the summary wont disappear until the page is refreshed sometimes
