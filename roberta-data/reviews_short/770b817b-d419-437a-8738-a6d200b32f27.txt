I kind of was expecting a little bit more.

The user interface is complicated compared to the previous software I used. Some basic features are missing such as the ability from a guest to book direct from a quote we send.

The new mobile version is not user friendly and was a big disappointment.

The Quickbooks integration should be great if working properly. Support team tried helping but when I started using real life it seems not be integrated properly. I'm waiting the end of the year to seat with my CPA and try to adjust that with his help.
This is a great system to track all of the Properties that your company manages.
It is fairly user friendly and easy to sift through for what ever information you are looking for.
I have been working with Ciirus for several years and have found the software to be cutting edge, and both easy to use and understand.  The staff is approachable and responsive to my needs and the support is on point. They have a great combination of competence and attitude.  What I like best though is that they are innovative in ways which grows my business.   The channel partners they have brought on have been great and the high touch high tech approach to the software platforms on my phone and tablets make my business run smoother.  They are always looking for new ways to enhance the software and to make the Ciirus experience satisfying.  I have used other short term rental management software and I would definitely recommend Ciirus.
The ability to maintain traction of all incoming and outgoing guests! Ciirus keeps very detailed notes of everything that is done, which makes it easy to track down the history and keep track of the many events that occur throughout a guest's stay.
