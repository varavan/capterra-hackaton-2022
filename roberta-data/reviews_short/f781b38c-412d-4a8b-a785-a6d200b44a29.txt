I've used this for years without issue. While primarily at homer to backup photos, music, and data drives with no issues.  At work I've used this on our web servers in the dmz as often our backup solutions has issues running properly in that space
I'm using this little piece of software from more than 16 years. It saved my back few times and only for this simple reason I consider it INVALUABLE!
I have been a very satisfied user of your backup tool for at least twenty years.  I began using it when I was employed in government, working within a network environment that was somewhat unreliable.  I kept most of my productivity files on my own drive and backed up daily.  I also have regularly used GRBackPro for full system backups at less frequent intervals.  Since leaving employment (I am now retired) I continue to use GRBackPro to maintain security of my personal files at home.  
 I have used it for what must be over two decades without a hitch.   Nothing more need be said.
