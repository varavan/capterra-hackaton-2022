As a former systems engineer (in my previous career), I found the system to be easy to work with.  There are a few things I think should be in different places, but it is just my preference.

Support is everything!!!  If you are lucky enough to get [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] as your support person, you will be just fine!!!  She talked me "off a few ledges" the days leading up to the event.  Things we usually do in person (and for cash) had to now be done through the system.  Rethinking is the name of the game right now and [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] helped me iron out all the issues we had to rethink!!!
I loved working with Silent Auction Pro.  Their support is phenomenal.  Most of the people you talk to were involved with a PTO which is how they got started working with Silent Auction Pro so they were extremely helpful especially since I am using this software to raise money for our PTO.  
Excellent- we ran one large event (Golf Outing) and an online Holiday auction- both were made much more profitable and easy to manage due to this product. 
Customer service is fast.
