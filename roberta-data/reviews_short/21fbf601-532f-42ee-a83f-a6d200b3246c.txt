Casefox is a user friendly low cost alternative cloud based time and billing program with some very useful features such as integration with google contacts, calendar and tasks, batch invoicing,  and conversion to zero and quickbooks.  My staff can work remotely with ease. Its everything you need in a billing program without the expensive,  unnecessary frills. Customer service is also excellent.  I highly recommend this product, 
Case Fox is the best--have tried several others and Case Fox beats them all
It does everything you need and support is always there if needed .
CaseFox is an excellent choice for a solo, small, or medium law firm.  I have used CaseFox for just over a year now without any major issues. Support has always been prompt (sometimes within minutes). Invoicing and acceptance of payment (PayPal) is straight forward and hassle-free. I do wish, however, there were other payment processing options available, and more robust client-side tools. 
We love using CaseFox for our law firm billing!  One of the best features is that different staff members can access cases to enter their time, and the entries/updates are immediate.  There's no having to "export" time entries at the end of the month.  Having the ability to convert bills to LEDES documents is a must for us also.  CaseFox is extremely user friendly and meets all of our billing needs!
