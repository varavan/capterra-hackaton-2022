Overall,an okay product that needs improvement.
It has been rough.
Savings in labor as we are letting the system streamline the work.
We are looking forward to the recruiting being done in Dayforce and onboarding right into the system.
We recently implemented the Performance Management module and it has streamlined our review process.
I'd describe the experience with the cliche "it's a rollercoaster." There have been many process improvements that have come about based on Release updates and the interface is so nice to utilize. However, we have spent so many extra dollars attempting to fix issues stemming from implementation. It should be easier to make improvements without an added cost.
