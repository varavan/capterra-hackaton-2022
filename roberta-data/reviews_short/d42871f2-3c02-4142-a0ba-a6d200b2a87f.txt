NCR Aloha is a legacy system. You get the familiarity of it because everyone in the hospitality industry has used it at some point or another. Front of house users enjoy it because they know it because it's been around forever, but it needs to catch up to all the offers and functionality that other Cloud based platforms are offering. 
Poor communication from support. Doesn’t seem like anyone cares. They fix one problem and create another. I’ve had Aloha for 18 years and after this Windows 10 upgrade I will be looking for a new POS system when the next upgrade is required
I've had great experiences with Aloha over the years. Customer support knows when to escalate issues and generally the response times are quick.  The software is easy to learn for FOH and back office manager functions are intuitive.
Absolutely great across the board
