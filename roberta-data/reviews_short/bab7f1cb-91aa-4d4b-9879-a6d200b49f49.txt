Excellent. The people of Intellect are great to work with  and  are  committed to the success of their clients.
 They anticipated our needs  and were responsive with questions and concerns. The cost were was very reasonable making it within reach of our organization.
Used for managing a $2B construction project, specifically for construction management, risk management, permit management, safety, compliance and contract management.
The Intellect Platform can be used for a wide variety of business applications.  We used the platform for the following apps:

	Document control (global)
	Training records
	Customer complaints
	Internal non-conformance
	Approval to use methods
	Shorter time to get people trained and have the records require
	Global visibility to issues
	Compliance
We love that we can connect in an easy to digest , readily available format our tasks specific to workflow with color coded tags to identify process so nothing gets over looked or no tasks get lost. Charts and output documents can be generated to collect and archive records of progress and performance. The challenges to overcome with Intellect Software are mainly  with key search word articulation in document archives. Intellect Workflow simply does not offer too many customization options here. As long as we associated our files to a  focused nomenclature system for tagging , we overcame this problem quite easily. Our recommendation there is to assign a character system unique to the names of the files initially. Then a user doesn't rely so much on Intellect to dive so deep to retrieve files. Also, at a month cost to entry for usage can be high. We suggest using the trial then assessing Intellect's possible utility at no cost. The user will understand Intellect Workflow's possible substantial value in helping to organize workflow and to completing projects in rather streamlined, elegant fashion.
