Documate has saved me time and made me money.  I'm glad to be able to recommend it to others.
Before we started using Documate, we were manually drafting documents with MS Word, which wasted thousands of hours of employee time. If you need a robust document automation or document assembly tool, Documate may be what you've been looking for.  
I (and especially our paralegals) are very happy we found Documate.  We've saved a ton of time, and it's worth the monthly fee times 1000.  Because it creates a web-based app, we've also considered rolling this out as an intake or document generation process for our clients - the interface is clean and mobile-friendly for that purpose, too.
Saif in tech support is very personable, and it was fun working with him to learn the basics of the software.
Biggest timesaver of my life. I can't believe more people aren't talking about this!
