Overall, Eleo is perfect for my non-profit and allows me to track my donors and all related communication.
As a small nonprofit, every expense is carefully considered and Eleo was a wonderful alternative to expensive competitors like Salesforce or Donor Perfect. The customer service folks are friendly and they also have a great blog for fundraisers.
Eleo has been a very good choice for our non-profit. Once the information base was in the system,  it has proven to be an efficient and time-saving way of tracking our gifts to this organization.
We are using this database to keep track of donors and donations.  We will be implementing grants and volunteers in the next few months.  We look forward to utilizing most of what is offered.
