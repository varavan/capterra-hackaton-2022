OpenWater offered a solution for my department to easily manage a new sweepstakes program for our members.
This has helped our Awards process tremendously.  We no longer have human error when scoring our candidates. The system has saved countless hours for our staff members.
The experience has been outstanding. We have been able to take several outdated processes and make them all online and in one unique system. We have designed something completely for us and by us. The best part of the experience (not to take anything away from the software) has been your people. They have been amazing to work with and wouldn't have it any other way.
The OpenWater system has been great for our awards program.  The applicants, judges, and our staff all find it easy to use and the support from OpenWater staff has been above and beyond. Any time we've had questions or been in need of systematic changes, OpenWater staff has been quick to respond and always helpful. Zack and Theresa are AWESOME!
Incredibly customizable form creation and so much more.
