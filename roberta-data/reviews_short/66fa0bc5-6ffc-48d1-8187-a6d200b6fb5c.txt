First time user to connect our organization to online ticketing
Our costumers are happy to reserve their own seats.  
We have used Thundertix for over a year and multiple events.  It is flexible and easy to use.  If you have any issues getting something just the way you want it, customer support is the most responsive for any company I have dealt with in years.

The only downside is a limited suite of canned reports.  But the data is all available and you can take it a spreadsheet to do whatever you want.
ThunderTix is very useful for us when we are setting up our events.
Our theatre company decided to switch systems and the transition was painless and WELL worth the change.  We love how easy it is to use and our questions are answered very quickly. Thanks ThunderTix!!!
