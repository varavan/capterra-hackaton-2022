Sentric Workforce is very user-friendly and definitely the best payroll system that I have ever used.  The employees at my company find it easy to work with and can make their own updates.  Processing payroll is a breeze and if there is anything that I need help with, assistance is only a call away.  Top notch company with top notch support!
Sentric helped us streamline multiple software systems into one all in one solution for payroll and HRIS and ATS.   Helped a lot in simplifying our time tracking to payroll. 
We switched to Sentric from a very large platform that was overkill for our size company. With our last payroll system, it was not intuitive, it was not easy to navigate nor was it user friendly in any way. It was also outdated visually. Switching to Sentric has been a breath of fresh air. It is so easy to use, I completely got how to use it with minimal training (my choice) and I love the look of it. I have demoed a ton of payroll companies and I have worked with several different ones throughout the years and hands down, Sentric is my go to choice. Kudos, Sentric on everything from the sales process, to the implementation to the follow through on the customer service side. Thank you!
