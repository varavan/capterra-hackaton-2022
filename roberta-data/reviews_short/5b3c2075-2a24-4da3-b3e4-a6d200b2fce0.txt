I love being able to use box daily at work for file access. It gives our entire organization access to files and the ability to search for documents filtered by criteria online. 
Requesting permission from my administrator to create folders in certain drives can be tedious. 
Drag-and-drop and other similar features makes this tool very intuitive to use, since the integration with my machine is seamless.  Allows for quick collaboration and turnaround times, speeding up projects significantly instead of emailing information/documents back and forth.
I have not encountered anything that I don't like.  But I'm not a very regular user.
The business account or above provides unlimited storage which is more generous than other competitors. Lots of enhanced functionalities.
A bit expensive considering minimum of 3 users are required...
Very solid cloud storage service but needs more integrations.
When it comes to storing and synching files, box is a win. Uploads and downloads are lightning fast and the various clients are all designed for optimum efficiency. I like the simplicity of the service and the fact that they don't constantly push upsells and other services like competing offerings. Putting the focus on performance and usability makes Box a breeze to use.
Uploading large numbers of photos and videos through the mobile app doesn't always work properly. I had to batch uploads in groups of 10-20 since the upload task would fail on larger batches. Having to babysit the uploads is a huge time sink and counter productive. It would also be nice if box had more native integration with popular services and devices. Would be nice if the starter tier offered more than 100GB of storage but I appreciate that they have a low cost option. 
It allows me to access my files from anywhere anytime across the world and share them safely and securely in the cloud. It has a simple and user-friendly interface which makes it easy to use once you learn it well. 
Box allows you to easily and quickly access your files from anywhere anytime across the world and share them with your colleagues. Implementing Box and getting started is very easy and simple. It provides high security for your files thus making it a very secure solution. 
For new users, it can be a bit difficult getting started with Box. But once you learn it, it becomes very easy and simple to use. 
Great document storage & sharing software. Visually good looking and easy to use. The retention policy of software is great and you would almost never miss out on anything. Access through phone is a great feature for BOX.
Document Storing, Document Sharing, Version tracking, retrieving previous versions(if something goes wrong with the current version). Central location that could be accessed by all depending upon permissions.
The add ons with wiki are not great to say the least, and it has been stuck with same issue for some time now. Difficult to add graphs or other kind of content like small video previews or video tutorials.
Overall, a solid experience. Definitely has way more features and functions compared to Dropbox, Google Suite and Microsoft suite. I like the browser version more but it's nice that they offer the desktop version as well. Other than the few hiccups, I have enjoyed the experience so far and think its worth the higher price!
- Easy to use
- Lots of features and functionalities
- Desktop version which allows you to work on your computer vs. through the browser
- Good linking/partnerships with Google docs/Microsoft suite etc.
- Great customer service
- Definitely pricier than its counter parts 
- I've experienced one or two times when the server was down which definitely slowed down the rhythm of work and caused some of my colleagues to lose their work..
