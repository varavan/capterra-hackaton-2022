Lesson.ly has improved the communication of new information, standards, and policies within the office in a fun and easy to use way. 
Working with Lessonly has been one of the best vendor partner experiences I've had. In our search for a learning platform, I was pleasantly surprised to find this (relatively) small company innovating in a market where most others are falling behind. The Lessonly platform has gotten us excited again about capturing and sharing internal company knowledge. The support and partnership we have with the Lessonly team is one of the best experiences I've ever had. They have provided great guidance on building setup and launch, building engaging lessons, and best practices around driving adoption. Lessonly rocks!
Very versatile package that allows you to build, assign, and monitor self-led lessons in an easy-to-view way. Can even filter lesson completions by groups to dig into who has, and has not, finished the training.
My overall experience has been great, Lessonly is very useful.
Great functionality to take lessons when you want how you want with ease of use! It is great to be able to assign lessons specifically tailored to our company as well as other classes need in the work environment.
