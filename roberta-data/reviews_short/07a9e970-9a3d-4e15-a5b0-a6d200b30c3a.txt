Overall I am very happy with the Cake POS and would recommend it to other restaurants.
User friendly but not the best for analysis day to day. 
Really thought this would be a good system being that they are apart of Sysco. Turns out these guys have no idea what they are doing. Waited several weeks for parts and menu builds. 2 months later still can't get up and running.  Tried to return system company took system back. Then would not refund money.  Cake now has my money and my computer with no resolve insight. This is a company that only cares about your money. Not there customers.  Hope I save someone a headache when this extremely slow system doesn't work for them. 
The system is marketed well but if I could give customer support a score of "0" I sure would.  It took me over 10 calls to get up and running after they replaced the first unit. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Not even a owners manual, I thought with a large company like Sisco there would be good service and support,  I was wrong.
Itâ€™s been a great overall experience. Wish more companies worked this way.
