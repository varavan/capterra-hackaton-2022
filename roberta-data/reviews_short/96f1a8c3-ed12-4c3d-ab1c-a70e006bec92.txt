integrated financial planning (balance sheet, p&l, cash flow)
Easy to use excel intgrated controlling software
no support of preformatted report templates
Jedox has improved our business in lots of areas. We can now retrieve data for comparisons a lot easier which has in turn improved reporting in all areas. Forecasting and Budgeting is a lot more  streamlined and user friendly enabling all levels of management to get involved, this in turn has impacted all review processes.
Once you are trained on the system, the product is easy to use. We have recently set up the forecasting tool, this has added many benefits from saving time, providing accuracy and all managers have picked this up very quickly. This has been a huge benefit to our business. The budgeting facility  is easy to use and from a review aspect enables you to compare to many different scenarios/consolidations making the reviews much easier, quicker and efficient.

As part of the implementation team, there were areas that needed improvement but as we all worked together, this was quickly adapted so I cant really comment on any dislikes of the software.
Easy to use, very flexible planning solution.
Onboarding of new users is very easy due to easy functionality and UI.

Scaling to big corperate environment may be better. Better Performance needed.
Some Customizing option feel like a workaround.

Ease of use, fast support if needed, direct contact to Jedox possible
New releases are often not tested enough > sometimes a lot of bugs

We  use Jedox mainly for our financial software and property management software to create reports in the web interface. So the users are able to get reports without using the complex software.
Also we use Jedox to enter not such complex values into the database of the software.
- the easy way to powerful intergrator to import data from an existing database
- web-Interface easy to build (Excel-like)
- hierarchies and drilldown
- not usefull for long text
- charts not so complex like in Excel
- no debug-modus


Um processo contínuo de aprendizado e evolução.
Vejo que o produto é muito consistente e de grande performance. As aplicações para gestão do orçamento são as de melhor resultado.

Muito fácil de usar . Com um treinamento básico já é possível criar relatórios e aplicações poderosas.
Pontos da documentação necessitam de melhoria. Para certas aplicações é necessário gastar mais tempo para entender como a ferramenta funciona. 

The tool is highly intuitive, lessening the time it takes to adjust from any other OLAP system. 
Hands down, the most impressive feature in Jedox is its ability to create and manage dimension hierarchies and elements.  Having used most of the competitors products and an avid fan of Oracle's Essbase, I can say with confidence that no other product out there that does this better. 
Subsets and Variables are very not as easy to use and one false step can lead to bringing the cube down.  

Another pain point is zero suppression when used in Dynaranges. It should be much easier.  
Nunca tive experiência com modelagem multidimensional antes, está sendo uma experiência muito boa pois atende de forma simples muitos propósitos da organização.
Integração com outros sistema, resposta e tempo real, facilidade de criação de formulários e relatórios avançados sem a necessidade de conhecimento em programação são os fatores mais relevantes e de maior impacto na organização.

- A flexibilidade de desenvolvimento de formulários e relatórios integrando recursos do excel, tanto fórmulas como variáveis ou referências em células facilita em muito o desenvolvimento de formulários não necessitando de recursos avançados de programação para atingir seus objetivos;
- Resposta em tempo real, não necessitando de carregamento programado para dados inseridos dentro do sistema;
- Filtros avançados com amplos critérios vinculados as estruturas de dimensões e cubos;
- Facilidade na geração de relatórios avançados com cruzamento de cubos de diferentes banco de dados, a criação de "DinaRanges" e Listas suspensas que facilita em muito a leitura rápida e dinâmica de dados;
- Restrições de usuários  e restrições de relatórios seguindo critérios específicos de forma muito simples;
- Integração com bancos de dados externos, tanto relacionais como os multidimensionais.

- Dimensões como "Data" que são como características de texto e não como características de data dificulta na criação de relatórios e formulários utilizando os recursos de filtros e formulas;
- Aparecer na função "Palo inserida na celula" uma legenda que demostre a descrição da dimensão da posição do cubo, sem a necessidade de consultar no modelador;
- Quando estiver descrevendo uma função "Palo" aparecer uma legenda onde descreva de forma clara o propósito da função e a descrição em cada etapa dela;
- Executar filtros de elementos e/ou atributos dentro da estrutura de uma função "Pablo" poderia ser uma  vantagem para não haver a necessidade acréscimos de atributos ou Dimensões;
- Insights poderosos e avançados com gráficos dinâmicos pode ser um desafio.

Good
The modelling and reporting capabilities are very good.
Easy of use. Takes some to learn and get used to it.
It is very easy to get up and running and for an Excel user very intuitive.  Being able to have centralized data helps keep sundry reports all in sync.
I like the power and flexibility of the integration tool.  It has a very robust ETL component that enables connections to a myriad of sources and a very robust set of transformation tools.  

I also very much like the web development interface as it is very excel-like and easy to create very flexible reports.
When doing data transformations in the integration the fact that it is case sensitive I feel is a bit of an unnecessary nuisance. 
We are very glad that we decided to start we Jedox as Planning and Reporting System some years ago.
- The implementation was very fast. The cube date base is simple to understand and good to handle.
- Reports can be created easily, very similar to excel and without any program skills. There are a few great feateres that help make long and complicated reports to be designed quick and easy.
- By using the jedox workflows we are able to send out our monthly reporting fully automated.
- We highly recommand iXlog as partner for the implementation

- The drill-through, which can show details in all reports looks not very nice and can not be customized. Jedox support told us they are currently working on that.
Powerful EPM tool that helps us produce all of our financial reporting and simplifies our budgeting and planning process.
Jedox is highly effective because it is connected directly to our accounting system. The minute we close our books, we are able to produce a full reporting package and we are able to identify accounting errors by generating preliminary financials. It also allows us to complete our forecast almost simultaneously with our close.
Like most reporting software, it is almost essential to have a knowledgeable partner to support you in the implementation. 
I implemented Jedox at a lot of customers. Mainly for planning but also for reporting purpose. They all like Jedox, because we make their work life easier for them.
- Very Excel like
- Easy to use
- Clever ETL integrator
- Connections to a lot of different data sources
- Highly customizable
- Sometimes error messages appear and you don't know why
With Jedox we'll solve problems with budgeting and faster forecasting.
I'm  beginner in this program, so it's hard to  review at this point.  But  one I can say it seems that this program is fast (for our company current demands).
Can't tell it now, need more practice to realise what I like or don't like.
The ease of planning for end user where it seamlessly blend in with my excel skills due to its optional excel front end for analysis and planning but with an enterprise database security layer of jedox in excel under the hood and thus it takes away all the limitations of excelPlus it has some very cool splashing functions to speed up your current planning in excel by a million times.
Can be quickly deployed for any driver based planning and reporting scenarios in a matter of weeks and not months.Very powerful ETL component that can consolidate different disparate source systems easily and then give you the flexibility to plan what if scenarios easily at the most granular level with its write back capability on web,excel and mobile.
More charting features in building more intuitive reports on the web.More inbuilt robust  predictive functions for rolling forecast scenarios(it currently has a linear regression prediction function) 
It is very flexible: we use it for sales reporting and budgeting, financial reporting and budgeting, but also for reporting on product costing, capex investments and activities of our test center. 
It is a very powerful software, which is easy to use. I love the integration into excel which alows for completely new ad hoc reports within minutes. 
Also you can start with a small solution for a specific reporting or planning need and expand it easily, even during runtime. 
integrating workflows into custom reports and applications could be easier.
its very user friendly and minimizes the dependency on IT resources.
i haven't found anything i least like about it
Have used it to construct a Profit and Loss dashboard so far. It has been a pleasant experience with a steep learning curve.
The breadth of capabilities is very wide and good, suited for almost all EPM needs. It is able to be deployed anywhere as it can be used on the Cloud.
There was some limiting factors in terms of flexibility, especially in the Reporting side in comparison to Microsoft Excel.
Easy to use, Excel connection, flexibility
performance creating web reporting could be better, time performance
