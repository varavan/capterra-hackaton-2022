I have found the service to be great and the product to be robust. 
Network for Good is allowing our organization to build and carry out a strong donor recruitment and retention strategy
It makes it easier to track our donors and keep abreast with the rate of progress toward our goals. It is user-friendly, and help is readily available.
We love this software! We raised almost 5K with our first fundraiser, and we expect to save hundreds of hours of human resources every year. NFG will ultimately improve our financial status by increasing fundraising dollars and decreasing the work hours assigned to administrative tasks.
