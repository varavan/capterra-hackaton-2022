I feel like IndySoft has the opportunity to build a truly robust QMS application and have it  hub around the calibration core of the existing software. Some may disagree but I believe that Calibration is actually at the heart of a robust Quality Management System and because QMS relies on measurement you must first assure that your measurement protocol and methods are accurate. That is 
I use it daily and recommend it, because the application allows me to optimize asset management.
Overall a good product. I have recommended it to our other sites.
It is functional but frustrating. When other people see it I find myself having to defend its use due to the faults listed above and the cost. If I hadnt had a legacy database to transfer, I probably wouldnt have bought it.
