frustrating, inefficient
Overall, I would say I was not totally satisfied when we were using it as an EMR - there were too many changes over too short a time period. However, its purpose in managing payments has continued to be the reason we use it, though we only utilize the original app and not Rize since Rize does not have this functionality. 
The benefits that I like the most are: the improved reporting engine and the accessibility to a new mobile platform with detailed documentation.
Overall, it is better than the old system we used to have, but meds and med errors are still very likely to occur because of a poorly made EMAR. I do believe once that is fixed, we will have less problems I'm the future.
