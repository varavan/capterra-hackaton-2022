In general, the cost of maintaining a site running CMS PrestaShop is quite high, but if you have a serious project, they will quickly pay off.
I use it for more than 20 web projects - not only shops - and it is creating very strong revenues for my company.
it's ok but i needed more customization & more functions so I went to woocommerce  4 years ago 

at the time of the inventory no matter how much merchandise you have, prestashop gives you the inventories with just 1 click,
