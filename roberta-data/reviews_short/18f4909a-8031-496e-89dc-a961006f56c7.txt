Great product.  I highly recommend for anyone trying to efficiently manage their r&m costs across many markets
I work for a carwash chain that I cover 68 locations and this app makes it so much better for me and my team to control and know what is going on at the locations. I highly recommend this software for any one who has multiply sites and or team members they deal with.
I have had a great experience with Maintainx. 
[SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] has been a huge help and if it wasn’t for him I would’ve never even given this software a shot but once he showed me how it could suit our needs I pitched it to our territorial manager and he was on board. I am still working on expanding its use to all of our other locations. 
Getting the repairs on a timely manner has help our truck keep working without any major repairs
