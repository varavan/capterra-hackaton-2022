Overall I'm pleased with my experience and I would recommend it to other small business owners who need a low cost but effective software. 
However, once you're able to purchase something better or once you need something better, there isn't much incentive to stay with pcloud. 
It did serve us well as a cloud storage platform and I enjoyed using it. We did benefit from using it especially when working from home,
Overall experience with pCloud is good to backup my files on cloud for free and share whenever needed. It is simple and fast.
Pcloud business did help us with document storage and management, sharing and collaboration, but ultimately the cons lead me to stop using it. 
While we used it we did benefit from it.
