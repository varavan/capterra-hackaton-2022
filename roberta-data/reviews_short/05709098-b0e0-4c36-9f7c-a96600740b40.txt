I can't recommend the software enough
Just started and it was very easy to setup my company and branding.
Easy to understand even with all the features provided (well done)
It really help consolidate my team's wokflow and gives my clients 1 place to go to interact with us. We connected their interface to our site so clients can simply get to their project stations directly from our site.
I use Plutio for my freelance development work, outside of my full-time job. Plutio has made it easier for me to track my projects and their work as well as bill and receive payment from my clients. It, like most software, comes with some caveats but you can relatively easily work around them.
I use Plutio to create quotes, generate invoices, for project management and as a CRM.
