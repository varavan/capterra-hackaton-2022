I have been using Viber for some time now and I am very happy with it.
Also there is no option for blocking the contact so we can't block those whom we are irritated of. Viber doesn't utilize our GSM data service.
I'm happy to use this app because it got me closer to all my friends and family. PERFECTION.
Overall, my experience with Viber has been good. I have had no troubles using it for what it is meant for.
Viber does it job and delivers what it supposed to do.
