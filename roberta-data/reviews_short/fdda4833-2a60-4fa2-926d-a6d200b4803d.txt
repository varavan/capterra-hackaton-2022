Our CEO described the project as the best IT implementation he had ever seen and I have to agree. 
I have been a user of iMIS for over 13 years and I'm in it daily. The overall experience has been wonderful with iMIS. I have been involved with NiUG, the user group for iMIS and I've attended various events.
Members are easily able to manage their membership status, event registrations, company info, contact info. We are able to offer a member experience with members-only content, event registrations based on membership, etc., which has been great in driving retention. We used to be an association that was based almost entirely on events but now about half of our members each year don't attend any events and are here for the other benefits, many of which we make available through members-only content on iMIS. Great responsive website through the iMIS RISE tool. 
Love iMIS for the most part! Does everything I need it to do and there are user organizations out there that offer great free resources for this product.
