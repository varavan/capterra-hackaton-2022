absolutely let down and frustrated - I work in customer service this was just a crazy experience I don't recommend for anyone.  
Able to have people take tests online and submit back to the GoFormz system for my company to review. 
I didn't have much of a hand over training when i took over but i find the system very easy to use and the help site assisted me with most of my questions.  My fellow colleagues like using it too.
