I would definitely recommend this program.
I began using SAGE 300 ERP to start a project that was just being implemented. I had to build a chart of accounts and record numerous transactions.  I was able to do this task with this one particular software. 
Great Reporting and excellent Customer Service with Acumen. 
Tema Lube is into Lubes manufacturing and the company has been in existence for the past 20 years. I have done 17 years with Tema Lube, but it's my understanding that Tema Lube started using Accpac the Dos version from the start of the plant. It has become our backbone as far as accounting is concerned.

We are using almost all the modules and currently operating using the 5.5A version. We are ready to move on to a higher version. We are also moving from the D-BITS for fixed assets to the Norming Assets Management system. Modular Resources is our vendor and have done about 16 years with Tema Lube. They have been very efficient in all aspects, and currently they are the market leaders.

Even though they are spreading in the sub region they are still prompt when it comes to service delivery. Sage ERP Accpac is easy to use. It has given me more knowledge in the system structure and how data flows in the system. Using Accpac has been beneficial to us because it is solid and perfect as far as manufacturing is concerned.
