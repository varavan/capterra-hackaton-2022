Overall I am pleased with  TherapyAppointment.  It meets my needs and the improvements that need to be made are not deal breakers for me.  I find it affordable for my solo practice and it has enough features to keep my running my practice smoothly each day.
Not like other systems which have a lot of drop down menus, exploding text, radio buttons etc. to decrease documentation time.  The one included template that has drop down menus, is not customizable.  Notes are pretty much free hand typing but can be used with dragon if you want to document after seeing your patient.   This really is basic and when the system goes down, at least twice a month for the entire day, customer support is unreachable.  I have lost entire notes from system glitches and failures that happen frequently.  It appears that the up time is about 95%
