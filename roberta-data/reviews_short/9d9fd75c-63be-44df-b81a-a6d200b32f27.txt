We have a NPS score! We started working with CM since august this year. 
I'm satisfied but hope to get more knowledge about future developments of checkmarket. Customer behaviour is changing. Customers are tired of getting so many surveys. 
I met a company named Starred.nl from Amsterdam. They present short testimonials in 1 screen. Easy to deal with. For me that is the future. Expescially if you send a survey after live contact. I'm curiouse if checkmarket see a oppertunity for the future (new generation customer). Further more I a satified customer! 
Pro: Easy to use. 
No cons
PRO

Not only does CheckMarket allow us to evaluate our many training sessions effectively and intuitively, we can also test the skills of our employees so they can be helped accordingly. CheckMarket's support is topnotch, by the way.
