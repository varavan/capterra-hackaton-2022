The customer service team is amazing - always very responsive.
What I like best is the customer service. Once we signed on, we were immediately assigned a rep that is always there to answer questions and help me walk me through new functions. The other great feature is the ability to access EddyHR's HR Support Center which is a great resource for all things HR - it's easy to ask a question of the HR Concierge, or scan the state-specific laws, tools, and videos. This has been great since I'm not a HR profession by trade.
Even more than the product itself, the EddyHR team has been incredible!  They are so responsive, professional, friendly, and I trust 100% that they are here to help me the best they can.  Having a great specialist at EddyHR who is available any time on any day to answer my questions is so great!!
I appreciate the availability of the technical staff and training. Eddy is always improving the product to better meet our needs. I am very happy with the program
Eddy's team from beginning to end has been phenomenal.
