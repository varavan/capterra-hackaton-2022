We are dropping 2 softwares by using this one
It's been a great and essential piece of software. 
Overall experince is nice, as it is better from easy available tool like team view, as it offers more options and better user experiences. 
Initially, it was fantastic.  I would have easily given it an recommendation rating of 7-8.  But since the upgrade to 10.0.6xx, its been nothing but a nightmare, so much that we've been exploring other options, even willing to pay more with another vendor just to get a system that actually works without constant faults and bugs.
Since the upgrade to 10.0.6 in August 2020, we have logged 27 support tickets with their support team.  Prior to this version, we would have been lucky to log 3 or 4 in a year.
