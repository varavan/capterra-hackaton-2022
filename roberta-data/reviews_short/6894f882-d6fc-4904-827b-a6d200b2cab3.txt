Philanthropy is easy as a bidder for a fundraising auction.  Our family donates both time and money to lots of great causes.  As a bidder on Charity Auction Organizer it's also FUN!  At the gala silent auction the bid catalog is professional, bid sheets are uniform and clean.  I've been told by the volunteers that it all derives from the auction program.  

As a bidder for the online auction component bidding is quick and simple. Then, as I am outbid notifications are emailed immediately so I can re-bid.  I love the back-and-forth on the online bidding system.  Using the proxy bidding is a great component I have used to make sure I get the auction items I really want.  

I always end up donating more than I planned but it's for a great cause so it's ALL GOOD!


Overall the program is great. there is room for simplification, but its incredibly helpful when doing a school auction
It took some time to understand the general layout

the resources offered for me to get a vision of what was happening and for participants with ease and mobility was very important
