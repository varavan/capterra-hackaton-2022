I've been using RE since 2014, but my new position is the first time I've had full access and my first time using RE NXT. It's been a bit of a learning curve being able to do more than I was able to do at my last job, but there are so many great tutorials on Blackbaud University and Google has also been a great resource, as have my coworkers. 
It's doubtful to me, especially after having worked with a few smaller nonprofits which have used Raisers Edge, that even the heaviest users in this arena are using even 50% of the product's out of the box functionality.  So while I love the product, and especially love it because it integrates seamlessly with Financial Edge for the accounting reporting, smaller nonprofits are probably better served with something just as user-friendly but much cheaper for donations/events/membership management, like Avectra's Net Forum.
There are many - accurate reporting information, NXT version, wealth assessment, various levels of access for users, etc
Overall, I think this software is exceptional and I would recommend it to anyone working in development. I thought it was dependable and well-organized. It would not only meet but far exceed any organizations expectations. 
Wouldn't use any other system.
