I realized with the use of Karbon that my tasks are more organized and that my work is more productive.
Invested lots of time with the Karbon team in setting up our practice on the application, but this investment has paid off over the last 3 years with our practice able to scale and not loose sight of all work and tasks each team member is working on.
Karbon solved a huge issue for Growthwise, one central place for all our work, lodgement deadlines, checklists and to-do's. Karbon is the 1 system that everyone in the team opens every morning and is our go-to for all information about our clients as well as work that needs to be done. Itâ€™s also great for workflow and transparency, as communication is visible between all clients for all users, meaning no searching for that email sent to someone else. It has saved us countless hours of workflow control time and allowed us to process jobs even quicker.
