In the department we work with a number of casual workers. only for events and another amount of worker are from the company in a fixed way, the software I use for the eventual ones since in this way I carry their data and the payments that are designated for labor in the event to which I speak, in this sense I can stay informed of the incentives and bonuses that were agreed before the event and that way we all agree
the goco system is a system that we use in the hotel marriott international for the eventual employee since in the hotel marriot we have many events we must hire trained personnel for this event so in goc it is configured to place the employees in an eventual way generating their payment for hours and that way automatically is disconnected thus generating a total account of his hours worked in the eventjhto and thus with many eventual people, but uq etodo this system we use it for the eventuality of the employees in the events
I really enjoyed the system as it allows you to upload your documents to make the process faster.
nice
