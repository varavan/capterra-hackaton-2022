The chat support has been a lifesaver; not sure I could get comfortable with the software without the support. I really like being able to look for cleaners that only clean vacation rentals.  Some of the bids come in pretty high,  but  I’m grateful to be able to negotiate.  I look forward to being able to use all the features. I do wish you didn’t have to pay to add your own cleaners, but I guess once you get set up on a channel manager that gets covered.
It has automated my cleaning management giving my cleaners all the information and features they need to do their job well. Works perfect for the purpuse it was designed for.
Happy customer
Only good is the calendar! Schedules are automatically Synced but I have had several fake posts pop up the same day or same day deleted projects that mud customers didn't do. Payments are to confusing for the cleaners. 
I have not gotten a chance to experience the app fully due to not receiving any projects since I've signed up.
