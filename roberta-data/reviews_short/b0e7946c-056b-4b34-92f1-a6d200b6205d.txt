Our overall experience is a very good one.   Customer service is fantastic.   
I have used a version of RezStream at the hotel I work at part time for almost 6 years. 
The only reason that I gave the RezStream Cloud PMS 4 instead of 5 stars is a lot of the features like more flexible searches and that will make it a 5 Star product are not there yet.  The features it has today are head and shoulders better than the desktop version.  I'm  really looking forward to the future enhancements.  I do not regret making the change and would do it again!  As always Rezstream's customer service is outstanding!
Excellent overall, also tech support is great to work with
