Great!
Overall, I can not imagine my life without Stessa now.  My partner and I currently have 9 rental properties with a goal to grow to 15 properties in the next year.
Great product filling the void for small yet sophisticated investors to be able to track performance. Overall I'm very glad I found this product and plan to continue using it for future investments.
My accountant loves it and it saves me hours of manual entry. As an added bonus, I have critical information in real time that can help me make good decisions for the future. Haven't really even scratched the surface on this part but it's all there.
This is by far the smartest software I've seen and I expect that it will only improve over time.
I really wish they were charging me something so I'd feel more confident that they were going to stay around and make the improvements.
