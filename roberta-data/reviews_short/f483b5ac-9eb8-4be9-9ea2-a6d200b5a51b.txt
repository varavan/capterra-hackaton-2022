Set up payroll for an employee and it's taken care of itself since then.  Nice and easy setup and the paychecks come like clockwork.
Our company switched to Paycor 7 years ago and we couldn't be more pleased with the quality of the product and how easy it is to use.  It is so user friendly and takes the guesswork out of compliance issues and any required changes that arise in the ever changing rules of the payroll and human resource world.  The peace of mind that it gives me and my staff allows us to focus on keeping our employees happy and secure that their payoll and human resource information is accurate and secure. Great reports so easy to interpret.
I have really enjoyed working with Paycor.  The system is easy to use and I rarely need to contact an individual for assistance.
Always have great service. Very responsive to our requests. Seldom have any issues to address and very easy to use.
