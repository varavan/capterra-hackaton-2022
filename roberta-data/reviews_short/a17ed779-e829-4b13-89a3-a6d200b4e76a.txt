As a parent, I love the fact I can go on this app and see how my kids are doing in daycare.
I love that I can see Daily Observations during the day and see my kids are having a great time learning. 
I like the fact I can see what they ate, how much, and when their diapers where changed. Love this App!
So far has been great
Overall I love it
My overall experience with LifeCubby has been great. Great customer service and great product that is user friendly.

LifeCubby is an excellent basic program, but it has a lot of opportunities for growth. I strongly advise everyone who is concerned about their children to read this book.
