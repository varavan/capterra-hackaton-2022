Dishonest, or going broke, or both.
All calls and voice messages went down today - no notice, no contact, and no way to get our calls over from them. I called their support a dozen times and no one picks up. I messaged their chat support and after 10 minutes of waiting, someone said "I'm very sorry that you are having such a bad experience. We are fixing the situation, there's a downtime". When I asked about forwarding our calls out until this was fixed, I did not receive a response. I have been waiting for more than 30 minutes now. One of the services we offer to our clients is taking their incoming sales calls - One of our clients discovered his calls were not being answered, and he came down to our office and canceled his service. That was a loss of over $5000 a month. AND we still can't even get him his calls back. We tried everything and nothing has worked. I even tested calling every number we have - I tried calling, texting, leaving messages, none of them came through. I couldn't even change our message greeting to let customers know. It has been almost an entire day now and our clients have lost SO much money. I am sure this software is fine in theory, but when something so important goes down and they cant even notify or assist you, that's it for me. I would not recommend this even to my competition. 
Terrible!
