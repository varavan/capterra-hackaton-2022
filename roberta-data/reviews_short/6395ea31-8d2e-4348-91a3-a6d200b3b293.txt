Before I used TriMed I was on some  nice paper charts but by using their EHR and office management softward (E-Medsys) I was able to reduce my staff and streamline office efficiency.   Everything at all times was at our finger tips so that we were able to investigate and solve queries in real time without resorting to lengthy dives into the "bowels" of the software.   The EHR software is very intuitive, well laid out, simple to use.  
They are quick and responsive to our feedback. Their staff is not only super knowledgeable, but kind and warm. 
TriMed has provided us an EMR for documentation and e-prescribing for our telemedicine solution.  I have worked with this company at a much larger scale for EMR, practice management, billing, and scheduling in a previous position.  I will always choose TriMed for my software solution because they are reliable, adaptable, respond quickly, provide efficient solutions, and their customer support and super friendly staff cannot be replicated by anyone.
