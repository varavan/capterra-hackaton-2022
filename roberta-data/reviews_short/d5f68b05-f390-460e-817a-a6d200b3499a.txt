By moving to COINS we were able to eliminate several Excel spreadsheets that we were doing outside the system.
With SM we were able to shorten both the dispatch and invoicing processes.  With CDR we have been able to eliminate a third party software platform and make the daily task of approving field time more than just bearable.  Both modules have increased the overall level of effective communication between field and office.  The COINS implementation and account management teams have both been great to work with despite some implementation bumps (as to be expected of course); in the end a solution was always found.
Excellent and easy sharing and uploading of multiple project data and files and the activity tracking and reports creation is effective.
We were originally a long time Coins TI system user and was looking to upgrade our system to a more modern platform. Upgrading an existing ERP can be a daunting task. Coins consultants worked with us every step of the way during our implementation process. When we experienced some development issues we were able to work directly with Coins developers to resolve our issues.
