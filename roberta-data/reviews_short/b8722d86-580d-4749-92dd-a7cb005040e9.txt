It has helped us keep track of our field time records, project details, safety meetings in the field, etc. 
Itâ€™s a easy app to document jobs and hours.
I have been thrilled with my experience with Contractor Foreman. They have been easy to work with, available for training and questions, and knowledgeable about the way construction projects work. Plus, they are the most affordable software I've found.
I like the products very much
