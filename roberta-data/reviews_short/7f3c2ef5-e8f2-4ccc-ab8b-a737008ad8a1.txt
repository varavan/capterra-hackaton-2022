Excellent customer service. The software is easy to use. Best reporting in the industry.
We have not seen the benefits we thought we would get.  The software is not up to Needles and trying to make it do some of the old function is not easy. Several vendors we looked at to help us knew Sales Force but had no idea what Litify did or how a law firm operates.  It has been many months and we still do not have a system up to par and we keep the Needles system running.
Litify automates marketing, client management, intake, matters, documents, referrals, reporting, and finance, all in a single, secure, easy-to-use application. By leveraging the power Litify, our law firm has the tools we need to perform at the highest level.
The Litify support team has been quick to respond when needed.
It's an excellent application for our needs.  We have over 200 staff in multiple locations.
Ability to create customized reports on the fly is very helpful
Ideal for Plaintiff firms that work on a contingency fee basis (particularly Personal Injury firms)
