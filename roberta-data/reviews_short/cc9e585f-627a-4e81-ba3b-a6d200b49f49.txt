Really impressed with IntakeQ. The online forms have allowed our practice to operate smoothly and efficiently from the very beginning. We have always felt valued as a customer too, which isn't necessarily easy to come by these days.
Our office has been using IntakeQ for almost a year now and it has added a great service to patient intake.  Communication between our patients and the ease of being able to fill out their forms at home has improved customer service.
I overall love the ease this has make paperwork. Not all patients like it, but we do.
Customer service is lacking significantly as they have maybe two or three people to manage any concerns and getting a phone call is impossible to resolve issues

They continuously try to resolve issues via email and become frustrated when you don’t understand

Their scheduling system isn’t made for Multi practitioners with a master schedule and I’m continuously having to have my therapist go back and modify their settings to allow us to schedule for them

Great for forms -terrible for scheduling unfortunately it would’ve been nice to have a one stop system
