My overall expereince with Jane has been excellent. The more I use it the better it becomes with added features and excellent support 
I might go bald if I stay with this software. As a practitioner, I love so many aspects but the moment I step outside of that role I find myself wasting so much time on little simple things that I want to curl up and cry. I've used 2 other companies for management/sales software and we are looking to move back to one of them. We have stayed with the hopes of finding solutions or that the pros would balance with the cons but even with the help of the Jane team, there's little they can do. 
I am so effing frustrated with this system I am looking for another one.
A well-rounded software with a multitude of capacities to run a clinic or a solo practice. Navigation can sometimes be a challenge but their excellent support makes up for it.
