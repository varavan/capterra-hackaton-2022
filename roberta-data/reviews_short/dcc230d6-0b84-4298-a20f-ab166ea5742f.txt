I am replacing my software after just one year of use.
Satisfied 
I am a new hire with a company that already had POS in place for use. I could find no handbook or user guide for system, as I was not familiar with it. Tried to run report for sales tax and it took me 2 days to figure out if I was doing it correct. Just not as user friendly as I would like or could be that I was not taught the system.
