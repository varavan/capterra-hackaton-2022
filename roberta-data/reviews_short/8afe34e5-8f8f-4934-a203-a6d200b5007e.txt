We stay on top of the state of our infrastructure with this product.  Similar products don't have near the capabilities and nowhere near the price.
OpManager has been a critical tool for our IT team since 6+ years now.  
For a tool of this price point/range, a neat feature is the ability to create workflows with proper escalation and approval alerts. This is a rare component for a solution within this price bracket, as some high-end solutions do not do this well at all. The creation of workflows within the software allow for the automation of many tasks and operations.
OpManager has served the main purpose for us, i.e. to monitor IT infrastructure devices and alert us before a major outage.
