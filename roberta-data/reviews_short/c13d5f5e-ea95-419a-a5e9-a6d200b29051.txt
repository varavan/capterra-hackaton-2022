ACS offers multiple levels of solutions for churches with weekly attendance from 100-20K. Previous reviews have indicated an outdated system UI, however, it is fair to note that with any software you only get out of it what you put into it and the UI should never be the difference between success and failure of any ChMS.  ACS employees have served in churches, on staff and they understand the needs of reporting, communication, member facing engagement tools and best practices in data management.  All software evaluations and subsequent implementations should be done with prayer, care and discernment with staff to decide what you need and why you need it.
Not recommended.  Extremely slow.
ACS was the database for a church where I served as Office Manager. It tracked giving, profiles of our members, classes, attendance, the list was truly endless. I also utilized it to generate Year End Giving Statements for tax purposes.
