This is resolving a onsite and offsite backup issue for a small business and it did it at a reasonable cost.
security of files and continuous backing up of those files
Easy to use and non problematic to manage all settings
It has been reasonable, one time when we had problems it was quite frustrating as it seemed almost impossible to just be able to call and get hands on help, but I think I finally was able to talk to a person. I understand your system, but sometimes when your problem is complex, it needs to be talked through but I eventually was able to do that.
