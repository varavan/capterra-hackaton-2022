I like that people get a reminder and can self book. Donâ€™t like the app which means I have to go online.
 It let's me automate my appointment setting process so I don't need to check my emails every few hours, and I can connect it to my Facebook, which is great, but I would switch immediately to one that does the same thing but allows you to send customers to a scheduling page that doesn't show ALL of your offers.
