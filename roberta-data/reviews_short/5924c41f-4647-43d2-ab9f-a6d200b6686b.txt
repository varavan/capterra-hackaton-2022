Great! 
sending large content without problems to clients
Seismic offers a great platform for our sales to be able to find the content they need to be successful. The Salesforce integration alon with predictive content is huge. Not only do we see value in the searchability but the ability to track content engagement. We see a lot of value in the LiveSend links so we know exactly what content is resonating with clients and prospects. Lastly, when issues arise, the customer support has been great. They take product feedback very well and always follow-up when those product changes are made. Overall great experience working with Seismic this year."
