We applied for the cews subsidy, and didnt know how we could call employees back, while helping payback some losses for some employees.  There were 4 different situations, and [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN], your representative in Nova Scotia 'Owned our experience".  She took it one step at a time, making sure myself and the administrator fully understood what we were doing and why.  They went through all steps, and made it exceptionally easy...all while being professional, polite, and friendly.  These are the people you want on your team.  Very well done.
 Overall experience, is amazing. Like I mentioned my boss decided to try ADP and the comparison is absolutely night and day. From the implementation to the after service. After 6 months I couldn't deal with all the issues with ADP so we decided to go back to Ceridian because of the simplicity, the peace of mind and the support we had in the past.

It is an easy to understand processor if you are looking for something like that use it.
Love it, the people at the 1-800 number are always a pleasure to deal with. I love the critical follow up from the various departments such as the Trust department and the Department in charge of shipping out payroll packages. There has been times where we are in a bind and it feels like all hands are on deck to find a solution even if its 5PM on a Friday.
