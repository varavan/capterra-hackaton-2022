I use it everyday to check in visitors and drivers in and out of our facility for pickups/deliveries. I love this new way of doing things. It saves a lot of time and helps keep us organized. We are able to see the exact time the driver checked into our system and what door he/she is in.
We just recently started with ProxyClick in October and our company fell in love. Both the Kiosk and Webpage are very easy to use. They always have someone to chat with if you have a problem. I find the Kiosk is very welcoming to our guests and they know exactly what to do when they arrive. All guests have enjoyed checking in during their visit and getting a badge that lists all the information about their visit. I find it very important because we always have a list of all our guests in case of any emergencies. The best part about ProxyClick is the fact it automatically sends a notification to the host.  
A professional solution which works great most of the time. The helpdesk works fast and very customer-friendly.
Really easy to use, personalized support.
Each time I have a question they are really fast to answer.
We've had this software for a month or two now. I am a night shift manager, so my exposure to it is limited to a few late-day visitors.
I like the warnings of outside contractors that are not covered by WSIB. I also like the ease of keeping a visual record of visitors.
