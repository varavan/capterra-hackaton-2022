We have been using this product for several years now and it has made life much easier.  Our work efficiencies have been significantly increased.
I think eFileCabinet is a great option for saving lots of documents online!
In 2006 I decided that I did not want to continue to pay for physical space to store client and company files.  My practice was growing, and every year I was purchasing more metal file cabinets.  I had seen e-file cabinet demonstration at a seminar and decided I would attend another that Fall primarily to see and acquire the software.  I did just that.  We then proceeded to set up files in efc for each client and vendor and started immediately scanning source documents and returns and work papers for all current work.  At the same time, we hired a temp worker to scan contents of our hard copy files for the previous three years.  

We have never looked back.  I am retiring after this coming tax season, and we have electronic files for all clients for each year including 2004 forward.  
So far my use of eFileCabinet has been a good experience
We have used efilecabinet in our office for many years and appreciate how easy it is to use, how organized it helps us to be and we especially love how much less paper we use & store. We have eliminated 95% of our in-office filing cabinets and it's so much easier to find documents when all you have to do is click a couple of buttons. EFC has been great for us!
