We were wasting a lot of time managing our contracts via email and Word. The amount of time we take to close a contract has reduced significantly. 
I really like outlaw, I use it daily, and I'm able to quickly either upload contracts or create / edit current templates to spit them out quickly.
The product is highly customizable to address your organizational needs. I especially benefit from their templates, which ensure that I write a document efficiently and accurately. I highly recommend Outlaw!  
I am happy with Outlaw.  It has all of the functionality we need and is pretty easy to use.  They are clearly building out the product more and I'm excited for where its going.
Overall benefits: Time saved, organized contract processes, peace of mind. 

I definitely recommend dedicating time to 1/2 onboarding sessions with their customer success team. Depending on how your company plans to use it, they will help you get the best out of the platform. I also know that the company offers highly customized packages to clients. I suggest consulting with the team to find out how Outlaw can best streamline your companyâ€™s contract process. Overall, fantastic experience with the product and team!
