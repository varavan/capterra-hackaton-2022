I like spinify! It makes our entire team ranking & performance more fun.
It's easy to use. We manage everything within the app and get a fun way to inform the team of their performance. 
Few integrations. It needs other services to make it more available in other platforms.
Intuitive, easily customized, and overall fun. Huge breadth of functionalities
A lot of things you can do with this that aren't immediately obvious.
In a business where we are all spread out throughout the country, I love that Spinify seamlessly ties as all back in and we are able to stay connected and engaged while motivating each other.
I love that Spinify displays our employees performance, business metrics we are trying to hit and displays it in a fun, engaging and motivating way.  
Spinify is great! Nothing to complain about.
I enjoy being involved in a sales contest, and being able to check on my progress, and the progress of my team mates using this program. It really fosters a competitive spirit among the group.  The leaderboards also look very sharp and clean. The platform seems like it was designed with the user in mind, which I really like.
The app is still a bit confusing to me. I am earning points in my contest, but it still says I have "zero" spinify points. What is the difference between my normal points, and my spinify points?
Helps increase employee engagement and workplace productivity. We use this to track our team's attendance and to allow our customers to send a praise to our team.
Only a few integrations. Can't wait till they roll out more integrations with Asana or Cliq.
It showed progress, but it didnt always work, there were time where we would wait so long just to get results
It didnt work all the time, there was a major lag between reports, a lot of the reports were repaearting
I like that there are different options to incentivize our sales teams. There isn't just a leaderboard to pick from but other ways to motivate people. It can really track granular activities, which is cool.
It took a little while for us to set up and understand the reports it was displaying. 
Spinify has added gamification and excitement to the sales team.  It adds fuel to the floor and everyone has benefitted from celebrating with others.
Spinify dashboards have been integral to our sales floor competitions and goal management. The biggest hit has been personalized videos to celebrate individuals who have successes.

One great feature WOULD BE to enable individuals to create their own dashboards, and to allow a list of videos to randomly select.

We're also excited to get into the store.
The interface of Spinify is a bit antiquated and could really use a face-lift.  The product is great and has redeeming qualities but it can be hard to look past the interface.
The software is an entertaining way to display accurate statistics for staff, track goals, and facilitate healthy competition on the sales floor.
Ease of use, clear display of statistics.
Additionally it facilitates friendly competition between staff.
I haven't myself encountered any serious cons worth mentioning at this time.
So far the software has been great to use.
It really helps the teams engage and particularly helpful for the middle performers, not just the top sales people who win most competitions.
I like the score board and how it highlights the top performers 
I honestly don't have any cons right now. 
Increased Engagement
Live, Quick, Easy and colourful.  Engaging to all staff and has driven productivity.    They have excellent Chat response times.
No enough Integration with Microsoft Excel or does not update features regular enough.  It would be good to have a phone number to contact directly,.
I like the dashboard and UI. it is very easy to use and the way the scores are displayed is nice.
I didn't like that there is no way to set custom ranges for competitions and scores as we try to do it on a monthly basis instead of a 90 day basis.
its more funny more visual better than statistic or report in a computer 
the most that i like is that we can watch all the report all the score in the tv and this is push you for be better you want to do a lot of challenge is   like a games 
the least that i like is that if you lose or you had bad report all your workmate know it because in the tv all the people can watch your score 
They have a really good product for the price point, and it has all the functionality that I need.  During the trial period (and even since then) their customer service response has been very fast
If I mess with the underlying spreadsheets basically at all I have to go back into spinify and adjust my leaderboards to make sure it's all still working
Very professional and we can buil sales team spirit Very efficient and you can bring good sales atmosphere
Maybe use too much data and please add some features on web browser and more management features ...
I REALLY LIKE BEING ABLE TO KEEP UP ON MY PREFORMANCE. IT ALSO KEEP ME MOTIVATED TO BE THE BEST I CAN BE. 
I FEEL LIKE IT UPDATES SLOW. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE FREQUENT UPDATE ON PREFORMANCE.
Keeps the office motivated and competitive without any extra red tape going into the process. simple
I get an email twice a week begging to review the product on platform x or platform y, I get that reviews are important but it's becoming very irritating
Great support and tool!
Spinify is very flexible and has well thought out mechanisms to ensure consistency. 
With to purchase you get training, and that offer should be taken advantage of, as the solution is comprehensive.
