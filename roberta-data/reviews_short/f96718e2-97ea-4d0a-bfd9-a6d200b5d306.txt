Well worth the cost!  Maintenance and User fees are very reasonable.
I am an NP and have used Praxis for about three years. I have worked with different clinics and EHRs, but Praxis has made for the overall smoothest office. The Doctors can build different treatment plans with their own specific questions, tests, etc, and I see these automatically, so each doctor can work differently but this built into the same system. Erx and labs, tests, etc, are easy. Meaningful use was set up with a quick call with our trainer. Because it remembers how you do things and how each doctor works with their patients, it is easier to treat patients as a whole team. There are some features we don't use yet, but we are working on that.
