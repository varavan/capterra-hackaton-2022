I work in multi-family construction and need to be able to do quick conceptual estimates and the later detailed estimates that require more takeoff. I've been using OST for the takeoff for the last 11 years. I love it.
It is a good software for simple takeoffs. Counting widgets, or measuring lines, and areas. Other than that, not much use.
Love the fact that you can break out projects easily and when linked with quick. I'd, it's a time and life saver! Fairly easy to use, especially if you've used other similar programs. I've only used this for stone and tile take offs and estimating but I'm sure all trades and general contractors will be very happy with their decisions. I believe this can link to Microsoft programs such as word, excel and even Microsoft project manager ...
