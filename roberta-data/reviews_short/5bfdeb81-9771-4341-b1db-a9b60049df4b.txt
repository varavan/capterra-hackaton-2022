It has been fine overall especially the update to the clients side reporting and the SSL implementation.
Super satisfied with this system, essential quality.
The service has been challenging, one year we were overcharged by 30%, another year, we had over 10 % of our numbers ringing to the wrong lines, lines ending to late and getting charged more, lines getting cut off to early. See the list below for more: Telephone lines not working When we get a new rep for Call Source there are issues, so our client ends up feeling it For example last month the phone rang at our location instead of to the voice mail as it was supposed to. Billing has been a challenge, over charged on several occasions
 Reporting is easily accessible with no prior training necessary. It's very easy to generate and export. However, the dashboard seems to be very cluttered and could use some restructuring.
Its great being able to track my progress in my calls
