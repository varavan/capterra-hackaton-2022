so far I am pleased
It was really great. It stored my login information for when I had to use it again a few more times.
Overall experience has been positive. Definitely recommend the product, it just may not work best with a multi doctor veterinary practice. 
Medici helped us quickly pivot our business from in person visits to virtual which allowed us to continue providing care for our patients whether face to face or virtual. We had a great experience from first contact to where we are today.
Medici has helped us implement telemedicine
