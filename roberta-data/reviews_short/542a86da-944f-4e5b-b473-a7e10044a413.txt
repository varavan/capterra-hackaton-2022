Amazing! They have the best customer service - anytime I’ve had a question I’ve emailed and gotten a response within an hour.
Beats the other five softwares Ive used in the past. 
For project management Innago is one of the best software that are in the market.
It is a fantastic product that makes tracking maintenance requests, signing leases, and collecting rent simple.

I have been able to scale up my business due to its organization and tracking capabilities
