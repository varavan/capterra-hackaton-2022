We are just rolling it out around the organisation and its such a easy sell as its easy to create processes, review processes and find what you want.  As with any system its got a few items that could do with improving, but overall its awesome!
Having used Promapp for around a year now I have found it to be an innovative, easy-to-use tool that has helped support our company's drive for continuous improvement. This is achieved through a basic need for clear, standardized processes in tune with a governance structure and clear ownership. An easy-to-use interface ensures that the end user, editor, and owner, all have a clear understanding of what is required of their individual roles and also allows for easier editing and feedback for improvements.
