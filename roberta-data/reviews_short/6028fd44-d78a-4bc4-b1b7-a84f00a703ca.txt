It has "saved my bacon" twice when I had to restore all my documents and application development files -- PRICELESS!

With ease of use, full localization and collaboration with cloud services, SyncBackPro is a great tool for secure data backup and at a reasonable price.
I have been using this product for over 5 years.  There have been a couple of time that something didn't seem to be working right but tech support was very helpful and the issues were solved very quickly.
We have been using this software for years and it has worked well.  Support is very responsive as well. 
Overall is a good choice for what I need to do to the point I've decided to buy for our company. I tested the various things I needed to do with the trial version and when got stuck the SyncBack tech support emailed me (pretty quick) a suggestion/solution. Impressive.
