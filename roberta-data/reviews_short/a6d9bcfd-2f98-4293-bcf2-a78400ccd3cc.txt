We’ve had experience with numerous CRM approaches that didn’t work for us.  Outsourcing to Apptivo’s expertise lead  to huge, cost-effective dividends for our organization that will positively impact our mission for years to come. Their talent was easy to work with, responded quickly, was fully accountable and produced high quality output. I was most impressed with their consulting process…from collaborative and dynamically creating our scope document to creating a custom work flows for our implementation of Apptivo to building our user guide…they designed and executed with the end in mind.  I wouldn’t build a CRM and project management system without their expert team who did an amazing job making an “out of the box” solution feel like a custom fit. We’d recommend Apptivo and its consultant team to our closest colleagues. 
The extreme seamless of the whole team and using the entire system.

Support team are patient, knowledgeable and on-hand 24/7/365.  
This has been essential in the understanding, setup and implementation of the functionality.
Each App connects with one another but each has to be individually setup when there are many requirement that are the same from one App to another.  This duplication of setup work is frustrating and time consuming.
