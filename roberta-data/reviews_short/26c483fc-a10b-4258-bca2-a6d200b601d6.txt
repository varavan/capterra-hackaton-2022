Overall, it meets our business and operational needs within manufacturing quality.  We use QuickBase in a number of our operations workflow.  Workflow automation, messaging system, and customizable user dashboards are 3 key features in this app that we use a lot.
This webapp has ease of use and it is very  easy to customize.  this is off to a good start as a great  product and I will continue to use it as I continue to grow in the it field.
I love Quickbase. But it's far too expensive to justify. We have to switch to something else ASAFP. We have fallen in love with FileMaker & will be switching over to that as soon as possible.
This is very good but there is an indigenous CMMS software of value called instanta.  Instanta is an indigenous web based application that takes care of facility management, asset register, inventory, property management etc. please visit www.sysservesolutions.com for more info.  
We use quickbase to track projects from their inception all the way through development and testing to deployment.  It's been a great tool in tracking our projects and tasks.
