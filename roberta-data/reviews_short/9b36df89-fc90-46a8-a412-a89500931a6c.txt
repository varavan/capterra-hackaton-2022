Having worked in other publishing and printing programs, Pageflex is relatively easy-to-use. We mainly print product flyers with multiple versions and it is beneficial to be able to do all the versions from one template. We have also employed it to print letters and other customer forms using multiple letterhead layouts eliminating the need to inventory multiple letterheads. This saves time and money as we no longer have to discard outdated stock and can update letterheads and forms on the fly.
Pageflex allows us to satisfy our customers storefront needs quickly and efficiently.
I started using Pageflex as a designer with few skills in coding outside basic HTML. In the years I worked with Pageflex, my team leaned how to apply various scripts to our products and enhance what we were able to accomplish. Pageflex also allows users to tap in to to additional 3rd party tools to further add to their offerings. 
Overall it's been a better experience than the other two products I have used.
I am quite pleased with what I am able to do with Pageflex. I am able to fulfill all my clients' storefront needs.
