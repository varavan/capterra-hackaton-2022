Whatever downfalls the software has it is more than made up for by the amazing customer service provided. 
recent deployment of version 12 seems premature.  Features are lacking that were present in v10. Reporting and database management features are still severely lacking.
Recommendation:   Either provide the database management tools needed to effectively keep product data (pricing, packaging, etc.) up to date, or offer that service to customers!
This program allows us to evaluate jobs after the fact and provides an accurate list for us to order off of. We are very happy with the program
