Unfortunately Valant has caused more problems than it has solved.
We have had problems with getting any customer service and help with technical issues. They have told us for at least 2 years that an upgrade was coming to the system so we did not change after the first year because we were holding out, but now it has been too long and we are seeking a new provider. 
This EMR is very user friendly, easy to submit your own billing also. The notes are pretty intuitive but some areas could be better. When i had issues with bugs in the forms, it took quite a while to get them addressed, even though the fix was pretty minor. Overall, a pretty handy EMR and I would choose it again.
