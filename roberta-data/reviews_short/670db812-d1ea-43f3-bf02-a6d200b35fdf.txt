Contractworks/Securedocs is an excellent portal for small companies who have historically managed documents and their associated data through lists and spreadsheets. generating reports is easy and automatic deadline tracking is helpful. having all the documents accessable through a single database assures visibility and to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. 
Aside from the fact that the software tool is incredibly user friendly and easy to learn the customer service experience with ContractWorks is top-notch!  They will spend as much time with you as you need to get trained so you can get comfortable with the software. You can also contact them anytime and get a question answered quickly with a comprehensive response.  We are a relatively new user and still working on uploading agreements to the tool, and along the way they have added additional functionality which has been incredibly useful.  They are willing to listen to suggestions for additional functionality  and have already implemented one of my suggestions!  They care about their business on a personal level and are continually working on improving their product to reflect the customers needs.
Documents are being routed much more efficicently now.  I can see where the document is in the approval process and actually have an answer for someone if asked. As opposed to previously, I couldn't tell whose desk the contract file was on.
ContractWorks contacts have been very helpful and user friendly during the time we've been using the software. 
We have set up our Legal Database in contract works, and everybody loves it. It is very easy to use and find the way around, with a lot of very useful features. You can tag documents, set alarms and create individual reports. 
... and the support is also very helpful!
Great Product
