The pros is this is an easy way to share documents and organize our deals and control who has access to them. It is secure and safe.

The cons is I find it difficult with the new user groups to be able to do what we need as efficiently. If we were able to control this function by having the ability to turn it on or off, or create user groups with users from different companies that would be great. Also, the option to use a group that was already created would be great, as we normally have many of the same people going into one group. 
Overall, experience has been good and can really recommend.
