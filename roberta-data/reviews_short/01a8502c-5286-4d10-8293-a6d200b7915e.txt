Wufoo is helpful for creating any type of form in which you want someone to enter some type of information. Terms of service, agreements, anything like that its great. 
Wufoo is a great tool for creating surveys/questionnaires. We used it a lot at my last job and it made it very easy to run reports in excel for things like mail merges, email blasts, etc.
My clients like Wufoo so I use it mostly for them.
