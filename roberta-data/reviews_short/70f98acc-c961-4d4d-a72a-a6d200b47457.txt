Overall iAuditor is a life saver on the projects. It helps get real-time data to the field craft on how to better work safely! I definitely support the system!
I am a Asset Management Technical Author trying to offer electronic inspection forms to the maintenance fitters. I Auditor has all the responses (numbers, letters, signatures, photos), built into the software.
The dashboard allows supervision and management to view the results and act on the actions as applicable
Overall this will make things easier, I no longer have to print off excessive quantities of paper as I can use a tablet to enter the data, I can use the camera feature to attach images and I can send actions and report direct by email.  I am very pleased with I Auditor.
Absolutely worth the time and money!
