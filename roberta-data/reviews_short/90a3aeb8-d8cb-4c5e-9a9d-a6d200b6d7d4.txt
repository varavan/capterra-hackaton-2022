Tabs3 as a time and billing software is easy to setup and easy to use.  The Tabs3 software is versatile in the delivery and layout to the client so you can meet your client's requirements.  From solo law firms to large insurance defense firms, your billing requirements are met.  The electronic billing requirements required for insurance defense firms are easily generated with Tabs3 and a another module called Task Bill.

The customer support is the best on the market.  The hold times are minimal and you have knowledgeable personnel when they answer.

The integration with PracticeMaster is seamless.  The integration is great with its General Ledger and Trust modules for those needs.  The integration with QuickBooks if also very good, if your accountant prefers QuickBooks.  The web connection in its Platinum version make time entry from any place with internet connection very easy.

I highly recommend Tabs3 billing software.
I have used this software ever since the ABA Technology Section approved it in the 1980s.  It is easy to use, accurate, comprehensive, and indispensable for my law practice.  I love that it integrates seamlessly with the other STI software that I use.
We've used Tabs3 for almost 30 years.    Great program and it fits our firm.    My only suggestion would be as to setting up client numbers for the same client - it wants to automatically put in the address or link all of the files which sometimes just doesn't work for me.  Other than that -- I'm a 100% fan!
