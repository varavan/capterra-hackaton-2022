Deltek offers endless options and customizations. This is great if you need it and get trained on it, cumbersome if you don't need or don't invest the time to learn.
Deltek gives companies a brand new toolbox that allows them to move forward through innovation and automation.  The potential is almost limitless for firms with an open-minded approach to organizational transformation.  The support during the sales cycle and through the implementation process has been a pleasant surprise.  We have been thrilled both by the functionality we're currently utilizing (which has been very basic to start), and by the opportunities we see to further develop.

We've slowly gained by-in from our staff and stakeholders through patient demonstration of value month by month.  We are most excited by the journey Vision is embarking on next.  Access across devices through apps and widgets is an absolute necessity for the future.

Thanks, Deltek for your dedication to development.
Hands down this is the best Project Management and Accounting software for a small Engineering Firm.  I have been in this Business over 30 years and Vision has facilitated the ability to process information in the most efficient way, accuracy an timely manner
Overall, love it.  In the past, had to use an additional program for billing.
