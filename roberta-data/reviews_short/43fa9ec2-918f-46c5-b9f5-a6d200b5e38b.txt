I use OneSite on a daily basis at work. For the most part I am able to use it with no problems and when I do encounter them, their customer service department is always ready to help.  It is confusing when you call customer service to get to the right department but once you are there they are usually able to help.
Maintenance and repair of rented properties, new leases, lease renewals.
I wouldn't call this program an industry leader, but I would say it is better than rent manager in most respects.
