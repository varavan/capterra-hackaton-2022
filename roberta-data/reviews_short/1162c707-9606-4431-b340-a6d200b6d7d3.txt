Overall the survey worked fine. A couple of major points:

1. When editing a question in the back-end, if you have the text field in code view, any changes that you make are not updated when you save. This caused me to have to go back and update a bunch of questions.

2. When users were at the event, if they switched to a different app on their phones (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, etc.) when they would go back to the survey, they would have to start over again. This frustrated a lot of people.
I’ve found my experience to be time consuming yet enjoyable.  When you get to see what’s been created it seems worthwhile.
I really appreciate SurveyAnyPlace and they are still adding more and more functions into it. I strongly recommend it to corporate use!
