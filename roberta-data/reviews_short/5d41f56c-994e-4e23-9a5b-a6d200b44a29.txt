Awful customer service and on-boarding protocol. 
Overall Grasshoopper is a fun, potential money maker for those who like to invest and keep up with current trends in Stock. 
Overall it has been a convenient way for the team to keep track of phone calls and voicemail.  And definitely appreciated the fact that the application was easy to learn.
