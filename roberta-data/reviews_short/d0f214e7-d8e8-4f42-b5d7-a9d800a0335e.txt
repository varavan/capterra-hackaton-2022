subpar. If I were starting a company I would not use Vsee over Zoom unless the above problems were remedied.
We selected this chat for medical conversations with office personnel, medical personnel, and patients. Vsee delivered exactly as promised. While you had to pay for the HIPPA compliance certificate, the same security structures and platform was in place. 
The team is incredibly responsive.  Nimble.  Intelligent.  They listened offered great solutions and adapted to our needs - immediately.   
For a free version that is HIPAA compliant, VSee is great! I don't need or use (or long-for) the bells and whistles that paid versions of video platforms offer. But, I am limited to seeing one client at a time: no groups for me using VSee (or most other free HIPAA compliant platforms). A client list would be handy, but I do fine without one. Other well-known and popular platforms (Whatsapp, Skype) that are available to the general public provide better quality, but they are not HIPAA compliant. At some point, that will become an issue for therapists. I found that the free version of Zoom adapts better to low bandwidth. I use Doxy, Zoom and Whatsapp as well.
Overall, I really enjoy using VSee which is my first choice in teletherapy platforms with doxy being my backup for clients who complain they are unable to use VSee.
