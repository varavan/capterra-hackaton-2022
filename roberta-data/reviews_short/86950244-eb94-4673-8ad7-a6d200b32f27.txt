As a new user, I found ChurchTrac an exceptional tool that addresses the needs of our church. I was able to choose a plan that works well with our ministries, and there are many ways to expand our communication to members.
This software allows me to track every church member and their giving. This software also allows me to print each person and their contributions at the end of the year for their tax purposes.
The ability to see the overall health of our new church and monitor its growth in an efficient manner.
It's organized in a way that seems intuitive. It's specifically for churches - not for-profit companies. It keeps track of information that I keep track of like giving, pledges, members, bills paid, account balances, special funds, categories for accounting purposes - and sub-categories, etc. It's easy to correct most mistakes I make without throwing the whole program into a tizzy. AND, the price is reasonable. It's fairly priced based on the number of members the church has.
