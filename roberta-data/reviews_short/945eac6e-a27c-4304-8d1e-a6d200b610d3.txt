With the system we can keep track of our call for applications. It gives a holistic picture of the entire process and the status of all the call openings. It makes it easy for recruiting managers to screen applicants as soon as they apply and to rate and write comments immediately. 
When I first logged on to their site three months ago, it looked too simple for our needs. I thought maybe I would need to check out something more "heavy" for our needs. But after I took the trial on the free plan, this tool surprised me. It looks simple, but is very powerful. The most awesome feature is their unique email for every opening - so all applications will automatically come in by openings. And its easy to publish openings everywhere and receive applications, once you create them. 
It's little tricky, almost most of the functionality are hidden or very complex to use.
Every user should've went through a demo session first before using the RB.
My company was looking a simple recruiting solution that that allowed candidates to email us directly and give us flexibility on how we wanted to present our job listings. Recruiterbox solved that problem and has continued to improve since we started using it, offering new analytics and organizational abilities.
