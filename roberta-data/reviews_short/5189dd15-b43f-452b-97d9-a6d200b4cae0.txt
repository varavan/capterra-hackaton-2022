Smooth business flow is the main and best feature of kickserv. When everything is working our business flow is quick and communication between us and our customers becomes clear. 
I was so disappointed by the nonexistent customer service! We spent 7 days and so many hours trying to get our questions answered. We called many times and left so many messages. I would recommend making sure that you have a sales representative or a support guy on your side (get their email and direct phone number) before even starting the free trial.   
This software is one of the best things that we have ever implemented into our business.  Operating on the KISS principle, Kickserv has been easy to implement, easy to use, easy to train the techs in its use, easy to access and all followed up with great service from the support staff at Kickserv. 
I owe the founder a beer...
This program is wonderful!  It has plenty of options to allow a simple way to keep up with scheduling, and tracking jobs, costs and employees, and many other things.  It also has a tech support team that you can message directly from the sight,  and they respond very quickly.   Our company has used a few programs, and this is by far the best.   I love being able to get in contact with a real person when I have a question, and they freely give out their phone number and are willing to call.  I just have so many great things to say about this!  
I got every benefit I needed for the job in the office. Quick access and specific searching for information I need.
