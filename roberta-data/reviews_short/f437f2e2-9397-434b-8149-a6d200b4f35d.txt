I've been happy with this software - easy to set up a nice looking website, and the calendar is a great tool. I can easily generate reports for taxes. I've been using it as a central place to manage bookings for my multi-family property from Airbnb, Tripadvisor, and manual bookings. The payment function is great for manual bookings, although I don't use it very often as most bookings are through Airbnb.

I have 2 suggestions though. 
1. Airbnb integration is pretty good but needs to improved - Lodgify does not import the dates that I have blocked on Airbnb. I have to block them through Lodgify. Also, I would like Lodgify to import the financial information from Airbnb, or at least the money I collected, that would make it easier for taxes and accounting. 
2. Mobile ap.... please...?
