We use clubexpress for a small sailing club, and track our membership, advertise events to our members through it. It's also our public facing website that we use to attract new members. The easy to use interface means that all members are comfortable navigating the website and our board members and web team can all edit pages easily.
Works well for a small boat club with limited needs
For home ownwrs association it lacks some basic needs and cusomization is difficult 
Club Express is great for the administration of our organization.
