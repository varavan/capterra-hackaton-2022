I have used it for some time and I can say it is very good to showcase hundreds of products. The updates and maintenance are quite easy. I recommend it.
It is provided with security features which helps in securing information of customers thus user donâ€™t have to worry about adding their confidential information of credit cards in it. All your transactions of online payments will be safe in it. It is also providing filter feature for search so that you can easily find those products that are your need. It also provides integration with a lot of other e-commerce platforms such as eBay, Amazon etc. 
Magento has a wide range of features that allow us to manage multiple stores and support multiple locations, multiple languages, multiple prices and multiple currencies.
