We have been using OpenSimSim for over a year now and all my colleagues love it. I used to get my schedule emailed to me, then I'd put it on my work Outlook calendar, then I'd put it in my Google calendar. Now I just open the app to view my schedule. It's half the work I used to do!
We are organising our time in a more efficient way. Our team leader is able to give all of us fair quantity of shifts depending on our availability.
Open Sim Sim has allowed me to schedule out further with the time it is saving me.   This is good for the company and for our techs.
Previously we used Excel spreadsheet for schedule and now everything got very fast and easier with OpenSimSim.
