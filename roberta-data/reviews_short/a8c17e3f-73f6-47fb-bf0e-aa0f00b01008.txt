We used this software primarily as a payroll and scheduling platform.
My experience with TEAM has been a good one.  We have grown so much in the last few years and the software allows us to grow without adding more office personnel and more programs.
Win Team is like an onion, just when you think you have mastered the system you discover another better/faster way to get to the results. 
This software comes with a high learning curve but overall I think it is worth it. We are able to have more detailed reports for payroll, AP, AR, Inventory, etc. Right now we are implementing onboarding solution for payroll. Also, having  TeamTime clocking in and out information synchronize directly to Team has been tremendous help speeding up payroll processing.
