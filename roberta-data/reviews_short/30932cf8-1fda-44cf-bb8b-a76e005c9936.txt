Jitsi is the free, secure, open-source version of video meetings that WONâ€™T steal your information!
Very happy for internal use, haven't checked the latest versions for calls with clients.
We have been using Jitsi to conduct meetings and virtual classes for our students. Overall, we are very satisfied with the user experience. 

I am constantly delighted to see new features being added to the platform (e.g. virtual backgrounds), and the team even upgraded their user interface. 
 I would definitely recommend it as a more private alternative to Zoom for teams.
