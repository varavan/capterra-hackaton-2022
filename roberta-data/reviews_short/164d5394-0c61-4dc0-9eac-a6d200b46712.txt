I did many free trials and this was by far the easiest to setup and get going.  It is also very comparable in prices to others.
We switched to Humanity 6 months ago and it has been wonderful. It tracks all the employees time as well as request for time off. 
So far so good.  I wish you had a way to show upcoming events in the schedule mode. Where I could list details like times doors open, event starts, event ends, etc.
