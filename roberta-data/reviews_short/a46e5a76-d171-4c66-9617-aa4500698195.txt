I am the administrator of a nonprofit that gives out grants to PhD students. Before we moved to WizeHive we had a long email and paper-trail for each applicant. Now everything is centrally located and stored in the cloud. We've streamlined the application, administration, and review process, which has allowed us to spend more time on getting the right applicants. 

While there are always 'nice-to-have' items on the list when looking at new software, the programmers would always try to find a solution. Overall, the applicants, reviewers and myself as the administrator, are very happy with the service.
Everything in one place, one portal which makes things easy not only for us as a grant making organization but for the grantees, our users so they can login, view their application and know next steps.
WizeHive makes my job a breeze! Their staff is always available for the smallest questions from this tech challenged person. Keep up the hard work!
WizeHive has truly transformed our application process! The ease of use on both the front and back end of the system is very attractive to our applicants and incredibly helpful for our staff. Beyond that, a knowledgeable and easily accessible WizeHive staff ensures that any questions and/or concerns (and there haven't been many) are addressed with the utmost importance and in a timely manner. We are excited to continue our partnership with WizeHive.
