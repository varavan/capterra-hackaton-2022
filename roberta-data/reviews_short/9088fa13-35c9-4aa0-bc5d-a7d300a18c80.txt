as the manager of applications for the institutional board of top managers I found board is one of the best solution
Ease of file upload which led to hours a month in time savings for our cooperative.
In general, I feel very satisfied with the performance and with the security implemented.
The first savings we've noticed are on paper, ink, and printer wear. Minute-by-minute changes to the agenda have been simple to put where everyone can see them. Last but not least, workers and administration have saved a significant amount of time (and paper) by no longer needing to make paper copies. The app's security is excellent as well.
I have a great experience with OnBoard.  Very efficient product.
