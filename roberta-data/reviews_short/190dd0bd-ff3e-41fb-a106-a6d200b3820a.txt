I am a HVAC Vendor for a home warranty company.  They like for uss, vendors, to use this software for dispatching jobs to us.  I have had no type of training, and have had to figure out most of it by trial and error.  The more I learn the more I like it.  
Being a able to schedule work and personal apt and being able to text the customer their apt time throught the software and make notes and just the overall set up is easy to navigate!  we work with a different company and they make us use a different software and it is extremely difficult to navigate and communicate to that company through. sometimes less is more. i love this software.
