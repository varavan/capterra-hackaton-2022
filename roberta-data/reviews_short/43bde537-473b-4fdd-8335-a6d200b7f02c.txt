Having used it yet
Overall I love this product, I use it everyday to determine call ratings, current queue status, and creating trending reports on call volume! Great tool for all users, it is nice that it has the chat built in although I do not use it because I personally feel the notifications are not noticeable enough for me.  Others may love that its a fast pop and small to reduce screen clutter! Great product, highly recommended for any call center!
Better monitoring and management of our activity
Ease of connecting all my agents and the ability to easily move agents as needs changed. Adding customers quickly and being able to provide dedicated, specific customer service for their customers. Also, being able to have control of changing messages. In my previous software I was supposed to provide 24 hours notice if I wanted the inclement weather message played because we needed to close - we are in Wisconsin - we don't really decide to just close 24 hours in advance, we wait and see if it is really necessary and then proceed. Having that ability to change with changing/time sensitive situations also extremely helpful.
