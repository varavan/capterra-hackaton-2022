It makes my work day much easier. 1 click dialing. CRM integration. Sending text messages through my computer. I love this software!
I love it, the text message feature has increased my response rate dramatically. I have clients right now that I would never have gotten a hold of had it not been for that specific feature.
Overall, after being around for sometime and having other dialing/ dialer services, Kixie stands out the best because of their customer service, analytics and local presence features. 
Kixie has been a great asset to our company. It has cut down our 'No show rate' with our clients which have decreased which has increased our productivity.
At first there were some kinks in getting the system to match our needs and/or expectations but with the help of the customer service team we were able to problem solve and make it all come together.
