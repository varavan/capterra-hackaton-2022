Fantastic software that has all the functions we need to run our service based business.
We can manage staff, allocate jobs and meet Customers expectations with the help of ServiceM8
Customer support is super responsive.

The perfect CRM for busy tradies as it was so easy to learn.  It works great on a tablet or smart phone as well which is perfect for our boys.
Love this software, and the help desk is very helpful.  There is a great library of help information too.
Multiple users at the same time from anywhere we have internet access.
Badges, making mandatory tasks a must for the technicians--helps with accountability and thoroughness.
The cost savings over our old program are huge.
