My office has been using Smokeball for several months now.  It makes a big difference in our organization and productivity.  The customer service is excellent.
The law office I work at started using Smoke Ball about 5 years ago. I was hesitant at first because there's a lot to it and change is hard. Now I completely love that there are a lot of components to it. I absolutely love that SB is integrated with Outlook to save emails right to the client matter, this way I never forget to save them. 
Smoke Ball has local & state court forms that pull the information from the client matter and add it to the documents for you. They can also create your own documents for you. For example, if there is a certain letter or form that you use, they will create it. 
It is also very easy to e-file documents with the integration of Info Track. I am looking forward to other implementations of integrations with other products in the near future. It is so nice having one program that you use for emails, calendar, case management, and e-filing. 

I have gained a lot from using Smokeball, but I have had to give up things that I view as basic and simple needs in exchange. The company is open to hearing suggestions, but they are not quickly implemented. They are aware of the complaints that new users have, but they still don't discuss them in the sales demo. I would suggest buying one license only if you decide to try the software. You can add more later if you find that it works for you, but really use the software before adding more as it will take you a minute to realize all of the simple tasks it can't perform. If you have used other major software programs like Abacus or Practice Panther, you may not feel like the benefits are worth the hassle of the change.  If this is your first case management system, you will be happy.
