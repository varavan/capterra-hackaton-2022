This platform is great and the team at Employee Navigator continues to expand on the tools that continue to make it even better.  While there is not a one solution fits all scenario, this comes pretty close for what we use it for.  I gave it a four star for overall, because there are still some items that need enhanced to make it a five star.  The ease of use and customer service is well beyond a 5 star.  I highly recommend this technology. 
For many of our small clients, they needed a reasonable and easy to use ben admin system. Paper processing was no longer a feasible option and EE Nav fulfills that need.
Perfect!  EN makes running the HR side of any business a snap, and makes life as an Insurance agent so easy!!
