Fast to install and set up.  It works everyday and provides daily confirmation that back ups are compelted. 
This provided a good cloud backup option and I'm happy with it. 
We have used this software for a little over 2 years and we have never encountered any issues. It does what it needs to do; back-up our files.
It is a good option for backup at this price. 
With IDrive I have been able to safeguard files that are essential both for my work and for my daily life. It is comfortable to know that your information is stored in a cloud through a backup copy. I recommend it without hesitation
