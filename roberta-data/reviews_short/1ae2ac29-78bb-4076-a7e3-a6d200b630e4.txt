Saves time, saves paper and very convenient.
Pros: I feel it's vastly easier to setup compared to others. Online Forms. I don't even need the document section as Online Forms takes care of it all. I just tell my customers to go to the website and fill out all the information and we set them up in minutes!

Cons: It's not as business friendly as I would hope. You aren't able to copy template forms between senders so I have to set up 7 templates for the same thing. However I already asked if something like this could be implemented. Crossed fingers
While RightSignature works well as a way to sign contracts and sends a notification upon its execution, it lacks features that HelloSign does in helping signers to organize their own documents.
