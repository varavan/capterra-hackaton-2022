Excellent support for selling and quick pricing and billing.
Easy EC2 backups in AWS
Support has been fantastic during the test phase - and I tested it very thoroughly. I wasn't really expecting to do anything more than use the free vesion - but the functionality was so good and the pricing so reasonable it wade more sense to just go with it. Well worth the cost IMO.
