Altaro makes it easy for us to get backups up and running and gives us piece of mind that they'll be reliable.
Their support is top notch, there's never a long wait on the live chat and their technicians are knowledgeable and quick to resolve issues.
I use Altaro backup from over 4 years and I will continue to use!
It is commendable that server losses can be taken within a few hours. New features (like CDP, for example, replica) with each new version, starting with free licenses for 2VM environments. 
A well thought out and very reliable solution that gives us piece of mind when supporting customers
