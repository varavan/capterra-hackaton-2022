We have been using Purple Pass for several Years, now along with another unnamed Ticket Company, We are now exclusive to Purple Pass for the Last 7 Concerts.
Highly Recommend to any small to medium Promoters  
It's been great. Attention and service is top notch.
Purplepass made it easy for me to focus on my show and not worry about any ticketing issues or cashing out at the end of the night with a venue. I could focus on my performance and celebrating with friends after, trusting that Purplepass had me covered.

I am so happy to have found Purple Pass and Gabriel.
We just completed a series of three concerts in three different cities.
Total attendance was over 18,000.  Purple Pass made the management of these events very easy. Because their assigned seating capability is rather new, there were a few bumps. However Gabriel, Brandon and their team worked hard to clear the road.

Will continue using their wonderful service for future events.
Big or small, they can handle the job.
