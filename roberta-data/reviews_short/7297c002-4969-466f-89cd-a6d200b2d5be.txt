Amazing product. It allows you to import your already listed airbnb listings, import bookings. It has a very  strong booking.com connections ( infact booking.com it self has ranked beds24 very high on booking.com extranet itself) , very easy to use calendar and automated yeild optimizer.  It gives API connection many channels like airbnb,booking.com, expedia, homeaway/vrbo and tripadvisor rentals. 

There are other products which offers all this , but comes in a very high price tag.

Beds24 continue to amaze me every single day I use it . I love their yeild optimizer, the calendar and their booking page ( booking widget).  

 
Fantastic. amazing. 
Beds24 is not just a channel manager, but we use it for this purpose for many years. They maintain their part of the software continuously and they update their endpoints all the time.
The customer service is fast to reply and react and  they are always very helpful.
