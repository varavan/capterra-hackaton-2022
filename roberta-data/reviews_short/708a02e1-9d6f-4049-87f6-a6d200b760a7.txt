Ventus software has helped us to handle all of property, consulting, and training aspects easily in one program.
The software has many glitches. I thought it was just me, but when I spoke with 4  other Ventus users, they all had the same issues. Bottom line, if I can't trust the numbers then this isn't a tool I want to use anymore. At the conference, questions were ignored, or they said talk to support, it shouldn't do that. When we call in to support, some items are sent to work orders, and then we don't hear from them again. They close my tickets without finding out if I have everything I need. 

We did a lot of research before we purchased this software in 1996.  We have been using it since
then and have had no real problems with the software.  The customer support is awesome and 
they are quick to respond.  They have expanded the capabilities of the software, we have not kept up with all the enhancements.  The support has been a 9 out of 10 even though I realize we are a very small company and do not use the software to the extent,  they are still supportive and do not make us feel unimportant.  I do admit there are a few items that I have sent to them that are still not resolved, but it is not a game changer and the software still works great without the issues being resolved.
