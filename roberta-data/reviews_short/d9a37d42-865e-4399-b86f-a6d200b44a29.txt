The first-time-ever I had to use Greenhouse was when I was in that excited phase of just getting my dream job. I had fun walking through the onboarding process and filling everything up. It's stylish, it's easy to use - very user-friendly. 
Our organisation switched to Greenhouse while looking to make easy managing candidates, that is, making sure we don't forget to close out all candidates who applied and interviewed with us. We've been able to easily do this through Greenhouse. I'd recommend it for any startup and large business alike with a solid recruiting team!
