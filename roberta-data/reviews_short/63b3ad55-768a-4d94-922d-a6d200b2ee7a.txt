Pretty great idk anything thing else so I canâ€™t complain
I love Bloomfire because we can house so many tools for our sales force to easily find, view and share as needed. From technical papers, collection videos, industry related articles and so much more, Bloomfire allows for easy sharing of a variety of content.
We implemented Bloomfire around a year ago to have a central location for our team's knowledge. We are technical consultants and although we were used to sharing information, there was no historic log of issues or problems that we were solving that could be leveraged in the future. With bloomfire, all discussions and questions are available for future use which has greatly benefited our team. We also enjoy uploading crafted content that the team uses on a daily basis. We love bloomfire! The gamification has also improved the usage and adoption of the product.
I had high hopes for this platform. However, it causes more of a headache than it should. The app on my phone no longer works (yes, I've tried updating and turning my phone on and off). The site on my phone browser lags and flashes like it has a bug (yes, I've done the above with the browser as well). The fact that you can't switch a post to a different group without losing all of the comments/answers with it is pretty much useless. Otherwise, I think it has potential if these MAJOR issues would be worked out.
