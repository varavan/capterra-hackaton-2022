Good integration with other SAP Systems, and the reports are just great and you have a wide variety to choose from
It is extremely complex for new users and you need training to be able to use ti the right way
Overall it was easy to learn how to use and we love it.
In the past you needed twovhybrid tools to create a category or content page. Since the update you can now do it all in back office which is so much more convenient.
The synchronization function has not worked worked the best since the update.
I think it is best software. I am using everyday but no errors so i am recommend this software. Overall too good.
One of the grate software. It is very helpful and user friendly. I like to say it is best software. Outstanding features and very colorful. Ease to use.  I like many tools because very useful. Excellent customer support. 
I don't have bad comments because i like it so much. My expectation is add more features & tools.
I've worked with SAP at multiple facilities through the years, and I've really seen an improvement in the functionality from my first experience to my current experience.  Overall, SAP is a very functional and comprehensive system for many industries.
Everyone knows SAP and so that makes it easy to train. 
System is very old school and clunky. Needs to be updated to adapt to current markets
- It is very easy to use. Not much complicated once you got training how to use. You will get good grip soon.
- You can achieve a lot with this program. You can go through purchase order, sales history, inventory, Old bills and what not in one place from anywhere in the world.
- The support team is always there to help whenever you stuck or lost.
- It is constantly growing and changing since years, it is very strong, big, trust able System. which you can customize too. 
- This ERP it full of features and comes with a lot of tutorials. It is great for a large organisation.
- It is complex to install. It takes around 10 12 hours and lots of IT experience.
- Sometimes reports took more than usual time to load. You will have to go through a very long procedure to find out where and what went wrong.
- You need to have proper training to understand the impact of every aspect to avoid mistakes in the future.
It has been very useful with some kinks to fix but easy to deal.  
It's useful and beneficial for keeping our software up to date and running properly.  We have someone who handles department and seems to be working well. 
We have had some issues with some procedures not functioning properly.   For instance, invoices not being delivered to customers.  Wish there was some sort of immediate notification to report any issues.  
I have worked on SAP CRM version 5* and 7* as a SAP Security Administrator and following are my observations - 

- Customer relationship management (CRM) focuses on the retention of customers by collecting data from all customer interactions with a company from all access points.

- SAP CRM provides user flexibility with sales, service module and also external consumers (3rd party vendors).

- It is easily integrated with various SAP and non-SAP products like Identity management (IDM), 3rd party tools and ECC system

- User access and administration is controlled through business roles maintained in SAP CRM system

- Configuration required for running the various models (sales, consumer, etc) is maintained in ABAP backend in SPRO

- Also, it is rated very high in terms of its Scalability and real time analysis and monitoring of Sales (provides a holistic view as needed)

- Web UI (User Interface) helps user to enable & utilize business functionality extensively at one single point of source through replication process of business partners
I would say the user experience for SAP CRM Web UI in terms of usability and acceptance is not that great (user friendly), it's a bit complex at times.
Also, the cost of installation, product keys, maintenance, operational cost is high

But, SAP CRM 7* versions have much better usability and has improved a lot from it's previous pre-predecessors.
If you have a big company (1000+ employees) you definitely need a complete CRM package and SAP is probably the best in the market.
You can configure almost anything on these thing.
After you get the hang of how SAP works, you will not want to leave it.
Throw anything at it and if it's well configured the job gets done.

When it works, SAP CRM is a good system of maintain customer service data and customer call logs and interactions.
SAP is an extremely outdated system that requires a lot of manual input and maintenance.  The output screens look like they are from the 1980s.
SAP-CRM have the best features about Interaction Center. Interaction Center agent can see the partner overview with minimal time. It has the best integration with external systems. 
I do not like the assignement blocks, if we have more data then we need more assignement blocks in Web-UI and hence more configuration trouble.
The WebUI is an especially great feature. SAP really helps in the way of tracking such as, tracking questions and concerns from customers and tracking customers orders.
SAP is a very complex tool and can move depressingly slow. I utilized SAP in a warehousing environment and found this snail movement to become increasingly frustrating because of our inventory growth. One of the biggest drawbacks in my opinion is that you have to use SAP integration tools for fluidity. Not to mention SAP is NOT cheap. This robust tool is very expensive and in my opinion, useless if you do not have the proper integration tools to work with it. 
Well, we needed something other than screen share and cobbled tutorials so we sprung for CallidusCloud. Feedback so far is positive and moving forward with full implementation. Word on the street is it will give us a breadth of scalable features. All sounds good.
My overall experience was very good, it helped me find a solution right away and focus just on that client. 
The pros of using SAP Customer Experience is the fact that they extract the exact information needed for Customer information. It helps you select the different types of issues detected from a client and let's you directly determine the answer to that question. It also helps integrate the client and the 360 history they have had with the Company given. 
Sometimes it can take a little while to extract information needed at that same time requested. It can get very confusing for those not used to using this system or anything involving CRM.
