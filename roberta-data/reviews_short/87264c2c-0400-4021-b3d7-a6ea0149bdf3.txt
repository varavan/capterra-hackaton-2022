Worst Company I have ever Dealt with!
Aircall, Ring Central, Grasshopper, Freedom Voice are ALL BETTER!
My overall experience with JustCall have only free trail and say to about overall quality is good performance.
Overall, its user-friendly and is efficient to use. It's time-saving because there's no need for us to go to client's contact records in Infusionsoft to take and save notes, because it automaticall does that already.
fantastic. I've tried others but at the end of the day JustCall actually cares about you and your business needs. they've always helped me when i needed them and they're continuously updating their software to make it better and more intuitive. will likely stick with JustCall for a long time.
