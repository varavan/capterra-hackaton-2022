My overall experience has been very positive. I recommend this product to anyone that works in marketing, advertising, or market research. Actually, this could be great for managers, too, who need to make sure their staff is answering the company phones correctly, too. 
We used it frequently and highly suggest that if you don't have a source to track and listen to your calls that you at least give Convirza a try to see if it can fit your needs. 
I have had number get turned off and other glitches.  In some cases costing me several hundreds of dollars
