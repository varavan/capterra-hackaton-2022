We use Infor for inventory management, accounting, forecasting and many other things. 
Increased inventory accuracy, better planning and scheduling, increased on-time delivery, improved customer service.   
Overall it is good but not the best ERP solution due to its dependency on fast connectivity and expert knowledge for use and deployment.
