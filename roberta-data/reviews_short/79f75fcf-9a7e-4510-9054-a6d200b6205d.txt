Love  it.!!  Highly recommend to any B&B or in of any size. 


What I value - we never have double-bookings, our records are organized, new POS system is promising, back-end system is easy to teach to new staff, it is easy to make edits/revisions/updates, robust reporting, minimum nights & more.  I like the new marketing templates - hope to see more templates each year.

What I find distracting - the online booking system seems somewhat "clunky" or outdated for 2016.  I frequently hear from our older guests that it was too difficult for them to figure out.  A simpler, 3-step booking might bring a needed "refresh" for the mobile crowd.  
Very rich format, large pictures and good descriptions of rooms.
We have a very good experience with ResNexus. We are fully satisfied and highly recommend it.
