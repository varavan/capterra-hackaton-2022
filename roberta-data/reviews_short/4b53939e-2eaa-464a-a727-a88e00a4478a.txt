Easy to use and navigate.  Mark S.  has been great, he walked me through my initial training and has checked back up on me.  Glad to know he is so helpful. 
We have been using SmartServ for almost two years now and we love it.  The software is great and the company really stands behind their product.  If we ever run into anything we want changed or any problem, they are quick to make it happen.  They are also working daily on improving and meeting customers needs.
I like SmartServ for the user friendly aspect
Its been good. Great communication.
