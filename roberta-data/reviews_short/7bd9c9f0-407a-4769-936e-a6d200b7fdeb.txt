Been working with Thermo since day one and the company.
Itâ€™s been fairly easy to learn and maneuver through when their are no glitches and good service area
Horrible experience. I feel I was fooled by the nice presentation and initial conversations with the sales guy. I tried to cancel after I was rejected by their recommended merchant services provider but the owner wouldn't let me out of the agreement. Their fine print is something to behold. Whether you receive or don't receive, whether it works or doesn't, you're stuck with the payment. I have a collection because of my poor decision to enter into an agreement with this company. 
Worked with other dispatching programs but this one is awesome. If you have any issues, concerns or need something customized they are always there willing to help no matter what the issues. Updates constantly to help improve your productivity. And the reports.... Wow! Who could ask for more.
There is definitely a higher learning curve for employees to get over. When people are in a rush it is easy to make simple errors and those simple errors slow down the efficiency of our workflow. I'm very happy with the approach the company has taken to customize the platform to fit the needs of our company AND our customers.
