I have been using Concord for over a year and a half now. As a freelancer who needed contract management for clients, it was nice to come across Concord. They make contract management and signing easy. A great alternative to services like PandaDoc.
We use a lot of contracts, it's an essential part of our weekly workflow, and before Concord, we had tried everything and nothing has come close to the efficiency and just simplicity of Concord, it's like email for contracts, but better. Our clients love Concord, and so do we. 
The Concord team is extremely responsive, and training to date has been outstanding.  We had been using contract templates in PDF with minimal fill-in capability, and still staff often cheated the system and made changes that Legal could not immediately identify.  The tracking capabilities and the ability to assign different levels of access in Concord is a huge benefit and is going to be a game changer in terms of staff time spent on contract review.
Before using Concord, I used to send contracts by email, compare redlines, print, scan, sign, and send it again. I can now upload my documents and share it with third parties. They can comment on it, make edits (that I can track), and sign it. Third parties now also save time and are happy about it! 
Once the contract is signed, I can forget about it since the system even sends deadline alerts.
In general, our benefit from Concord is having a single library of documents that can be accessed with precise permissions.  Templating is a time saver as well.
