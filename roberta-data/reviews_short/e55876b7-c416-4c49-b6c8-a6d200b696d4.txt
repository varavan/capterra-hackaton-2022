This is a great product that helps me and our office manager out in the office. It is an easy tool to implement and learn as i am helping our office manager with scheduling and dispatching. Its easy for me to follow what he is doing in the office
We have been using Smart Service for the last few years in our HVAC business and it is a game changer. We are able to capture ALL of the information that comes out of the field, track everything that happens and run everything paperless. I would highly recommend Smart Service to anyone with a service business. 
It's been great to schedule with, does regular scheduling along with repairs on multiple visits and planned service jobs that repeat yearly.  Ties in with QuickBooks, have had no problems with it whatsoever.
