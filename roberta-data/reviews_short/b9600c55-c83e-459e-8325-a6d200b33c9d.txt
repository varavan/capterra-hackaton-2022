The customer service is fantastic. They have great training videos but if you can't find what you need they are very responsive to email or a phone call. This is unheard of in today's digital world and sets them apart. 
I recommend this program to anyone needing a time tracking program that is intuitive for users and rich with information for management. It is an easy to use program with powerful reporting, using either the standard reports or individually customized exports.
Our company has been using ClickTime for approximately 1 year.  It is very easy to track Work Orders, Expense Reports, Time on the Job, and closing them so that you can Invoice correctly.  There is limited functionality for customizing.  But, if you need a great product to manage your company activities, look into ClickTime!
