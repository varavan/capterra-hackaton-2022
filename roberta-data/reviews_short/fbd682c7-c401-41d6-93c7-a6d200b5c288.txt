With thousands of Sku's and a lot of customers to keep track of, reliable POS software is a must to run a business smoothly, efficiently, and profitably.
Ok, maybe it doesn't actually save lives, but pretty darn close! We used POSIM Diamond for DECADES, far longer than we should have. We finally needed to upgrade because we were stuck using old technology for our cash registers. 
We started from the ground up and the POSIM solution was what made sense at the time.  Switching after 15 years seems too daunting to even consider.  It has suited our needs and we've made concessions to process and workflow to accommodate the software.
Satisfied.  I wish tech support did not take 1/2 day to get back.
Frustrating
