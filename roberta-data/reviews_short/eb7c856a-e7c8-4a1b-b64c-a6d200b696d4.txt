When our center first switched to SmartCare  it was a big change to us as we were in such routine with our paper daily sheets, attendance, and payment options but the SmartCare team was very helpful and made our transition much easier. We had a few bumps in the road along the way (as all technology does) that were quickly resolved.  The app is very user friendly for both parents and staff. Our families love the convenience of this app and being able to get real time updates on their child's day (espcially our Infant parents).  We look forward to the continued development and updates of SmartCare and we are so glad that we had made the switch!
Overall, Smart Care is great and I like the options of different reports.
