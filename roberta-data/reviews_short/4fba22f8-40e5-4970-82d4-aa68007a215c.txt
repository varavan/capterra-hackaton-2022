I monthly like its easy of use and amazing large community who built plenty of themes and plugins which makes any task easy for users. To regularly update themes and plugins manually. I have to take backup regularly. It is very nice.
Doing the bank reconciliations are a plus and you can do it with ease. What before was such a daunting task is now done with ease
The customer service is the best around. They are quick to respond and answer all your questions easily.
