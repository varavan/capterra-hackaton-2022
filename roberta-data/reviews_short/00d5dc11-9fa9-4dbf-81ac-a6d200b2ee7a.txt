Best for all learners and teachers! Excellent performance!
Overall, I am very happy using Blackboard Collaborate for my online asynchronous (speech communication) courses, as they have made my transfer to online teaching such an easy one!  I can't think of a better way to present material for students, and to help individuals during coaching sessions and meetings. So easy to use, presenting in an inviting and simply way (visually) and my students have found it easy to use as well.
The benefits that I received from blackboard was that it was easy for my teachers to get the lessons across. 
My overall experience with blackboard collaborate is positive as Iâ€™ve used the system to learn new job experiences resulting in increased success. 
Thanks BB! Highly recommended to my friends!
