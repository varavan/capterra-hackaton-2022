Overall, I wish I had picked another company/software. I feel the system is so complicated, with so many layers.  It doesn't need to be so  complex and complicated.  All I really need is an EFFICIENT system that takes the bookings and processes payment.  Simple and accurate reporting would be helpful.  I am still having problems with my connection to Expedia - having JUST been paid for reservations for summer of 2019!  Expedia still owes money for wrong rates posted, and I have no assurance that someone from Eviivo is representing me or even trying to settle this for me.  
Awesome
