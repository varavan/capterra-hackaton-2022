Overall we are very pleased, but have just started.  The customer service is something better than superior.  They are quick to respond and the responses make sense.  You can tell they actually read the input and then developed the appropriate answer rather than just reading off que cards.  Very pleased with the service.
Our experience has been that we have gone as a congregation from at first about 5% choosing to use this app to almost 30% using it due to it's user friendliness and convenience.
Overall it has been easy to use.  It has been secure in that if verifies you are a legitimate church or business and makes it harder for scammers.
We have been collecting donations as a goodwill for people of our community in need. We were using physical boxes but malicious people keep robbing it. Therefore, we swwtched to use Facebook's donations system. However, after we realize Givelify has less commision per donation, we switched to it we are happy.
