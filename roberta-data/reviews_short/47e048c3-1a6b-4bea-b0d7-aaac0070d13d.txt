RingCentral is everything I needed and more. I love the video call feature, which also allows you to share screen and more. I just love it!
By and large I am fulfilled it is uncommon when we have any issues requiring support yet they are consistently anxious to help when essential
This solution provides call conferencing to every user as well as a screen sharing option for online meetings.
Recently I had a few interactions with RingCentral support staff. Each time I was greeted in a timely fashion. The support was fast and easy. Pleasant and clear communication.
