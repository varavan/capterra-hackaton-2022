At the beginning Backup and Recovery required some effort to understand the program but now I am convinced that this is a great software if you have a large amount of computers to manage. The software can backup laptops and other storage devices without problems and the data is recovered after some minutes already. Where other applications take hours or days, Backup and Recovery finishes very quick. A useful feature is that the software allows you to compress your backups in order to optimize storage space.


Ease of use and peace of mind from backups.
