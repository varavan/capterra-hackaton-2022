communication with parents 
I like to check in on my kid. But hard to use for non tech savvy people.
We were using KindyHub and the transitioning to explorer was very poorly done. I cannot save pictures, I cannot read the daily routines, etc.. I feel that I am missing out a lot from my son's life. I am not happy with Explorer. I hope to see a change soon
Some features makes it easier for us educators however we need more support.
