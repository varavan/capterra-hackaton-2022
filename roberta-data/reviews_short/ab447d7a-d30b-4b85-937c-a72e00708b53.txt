We were looking for a way to access office PC's easily on android devices that were deployed in the office. 
they tried to argue with the fact i had cancelled almost 1 year prior.. customer service? nah
When COVID-19 hit we were able to use Splashtop to provide simple, flexible and inexpensive remote control for our clients to be able to remote into their business PCs. Our clients are able to use almost any devices they already have on the remote side and managing the users is straightforward from our side.
i have used it for several years and i also have gotoassist during the same time.   goto assist i will use for a few quick and dirty things.   but prefer splashtop if i am going to do multi monitor or 4k monitors.
