PlanSwift has helped to streamline our estimating process. Since getting the program 2 years ago, our company has been able to do concrete take-offs using customized templates in record time! The program has user friendly controls which allows me to train employees on the program very quickly. PlanSwift has so many great functions that allow you to complete estimates as accurately and timely as possible. Awesome program! 
We have used numerous products for our estimating department and have found planswift to be very user friendly.  Our project managers prefer it over adobe pro for redlines.
Able to do our job quicker and more accurate with this product
I just started using this product and so far it has been good. I would have like more training without having to pay so much.
   The only problem I had it this product is not having the list of materials I use. It was very easy for me to make them. I have been amazed at the joist tool and the way the assemblies work. I would like the hip tool to generate materials like the beam tool. I also wish I can become more familiar with this product or be certified in it.
   Thank You
