I work with a team of six who are in remote locations. With SmartVault, we all have access to photos, videos and document, and I can always be sure I'm using the most updated material.   It is easy to file, upload and take information I need without having to store it locally on my system.  This ensures I have the most updated information and I'm not using memory for something I don't need to store.
Smartvault allows me to transfer sensitive financial information with my clients safely.  There is an Outlook Add-On so it is easy to include the link in emails to your clients.   
I mainly use SmartVault for storing and sharing financial reports and other files that need to be safely sent to/from my clients. The user interface is professional looking and a step up from what I was using. At some point I need to take the time to meet with someone and really gain a better understanding of how some of the features work.
I love SmartVault!  It has allowed us to share documents with our clients (securely) and begin to operate our firm in the cloud!
