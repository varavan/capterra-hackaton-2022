Overall The interface is simple and the information you can observe is amazing.
Solid.
I think its very good choice for anyone and it saves you a lot of time, it is worth its price, that is for sure
While my knowledge is basic for this software, I do find it helpful overall.  I wish LuckyOrange offered more in-depth tutorials.  I think would really help retain more customers instead of getting frustrated.
