It was relatively easy to use and setup.
We have used LearnDash to train new sales staff with great success. I found it easy to create the lesson structure, insert my videos and then develop short quizzes to make sure the team were all up to scratch. It's a great tool that I'm very happy with.
Very good! Overall, it's been a very enjoyable process to set up. There are certainly areas that could be improved from a workflow perspective, but nothing major.
