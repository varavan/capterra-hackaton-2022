Strong solid support to make additional income!
When I first started using E-commerce there was a monthly fee as well as
per sale charges. I also had close to 100 fraudulent claims.
I have had no problems with Selz in the over 5 years of using them for online sales.
I just pay 2.8% + 30Â¢ transaction fee. Life is easy!  :)

Overall a great online service for creatives.
