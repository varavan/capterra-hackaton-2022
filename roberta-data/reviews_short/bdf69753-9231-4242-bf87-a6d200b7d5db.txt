There are many other scheduling software options available that are more integrated with other work applications. Therefore, after about a year of using Homebase our office shifted to a different program.
Horrible customer service
During my testing phase I found it very easy to use and implement.  There is an interesting perk with using Homebase that I think employees would appreciate and that is the advancement of money based on estimated payroll.
