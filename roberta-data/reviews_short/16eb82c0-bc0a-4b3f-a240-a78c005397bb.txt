All my content in one place makes content management and content discovery easy. The ability to track my content, gives me actionable insights to work on my content strategy.
Personalized content experiences have become a game changer. With my content being structured and organized, less time is spent in finding these collaterals.
The experience has been great. Paperflite lets me collaborate with different product teams and my content is always up to date.
Content Experience & Content Tracking has become much more efficient internally, post-Paperflite.
