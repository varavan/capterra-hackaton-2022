We love it. Irreplaceable to our business.
The NCR program is nice but issues with the swiper does not out way the positives. 
this is the worst pos i have ever used. the t1000 is horrible. i had to go and buy an ipad just to run this system. this product is so horrible. i wish i could return and get my money back.
runs spotty
freezes 
have to restart app all the time.
worst customer support ive ever delt with. 
I give this software a 6 out of 10
