APS Payroll processes my company's payroll.  We import the time sheets and APS does the rest.  W-2's are also generated by APS.
APS is a fully integrated system which allows for quick information access and seamless payroll processing.
Payroll functionality is super easy to use and hardly ever any issues.  If we do run into an issue, APS is quick to respond and resolve.
I've been using APS for almost 2 years now and the experience has been great.  I recently had another client reach out to me for help with selecting, implementing and administering payroll for their growing company and I immediately recommended APS.  The client has not been disappointed.
