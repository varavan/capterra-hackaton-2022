We have been using Pestpac for a couple of years now. Since we have switched, we have saved the monthly cost of using the program in labor costs. We have streamlined our service and can perform more jobs than before in a day.  It has made us the most efficient company in the area. The staff is always pleasant to talk with and always returns our calls promptly if they can't help immediately. We would recommend Pestpac to any business.
Great layout and easy to navigate. Love the access I have to it no matter where I am. Easy to get reports that I need. Support is always a quick phone call away.
