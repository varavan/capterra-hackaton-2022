I love it! It makes my job easier since we donâ€™t have to call as many patients to confirm appointments.
I help manage two medical practices and Luma is the best kept secret. It smooths out all of our internal processes. 
Working with Luma has been a very pleasant experience overall. From working with their [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] on the granular details of our contract to customizing messages with our Customer Success Manager, the Luma folks have been responsive, friendly, and extremely knowledgable.
Overall it was great for the 1+ years we had it. 
Completely positive and well received by all staff that use it.   I know I sound like a commercial for Luma but not a day goes by without at least one Luma mention in conversation.   This is a no brainer and one I wish other practices embrace.    We are all busy but at the end of the day, I have a fiduciary responsibility to my board to identify and implement the best technology to help keep the organization successful.
