I like to use it, and really think its easy and a proffessionel and modern appereal you show customers
Jeg er glad.
I've managed to cut down the time I used to spend handling our contracts. I never wait more than a few days for a signature and I manage them all in a structured way. Being responsible for so many legal documents, it makes me very happy to always know they're safe in Contractbook. 
Overall a good experience, it helps us collect our contract and have them in one portal. the increase in price was to large for existing users.
