We are currently testing out TalkDesk for our new softphone solution. We love how deeply it integrates into Salesforce. It's also convenient that there is a stand-alone application and a plugin that you can use while logged into Salesforce. 
I use with talkdesk everyday. I find the note feature always works very well, and the layout if great as we are often multitasking.
