Our overall experience has been wonderful! It was the best decision to come back to Brightwheel.  You really to do get your monies worth from the program!
My child care parents live the app.  I update with pictures and daily activities. 
I love this Software because its a very big help when it come of organizing you children daily needed routine. This will help you organize thing to do and manage your daily time scheduling
I cannot explain the weight lifted off my shoulders due to this app. My families love it, I love it & staff loves it!! I can't wait for more & more updates & user-friendly abilities across the stat to inline with all State licensing paperwork & expectations!! I can't wait for the paid version to launch!!
