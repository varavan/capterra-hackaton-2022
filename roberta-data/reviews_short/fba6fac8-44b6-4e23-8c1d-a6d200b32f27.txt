Positive!  I'd recommend for a equipment/volunteer scheduling application
CHEQROOM is a solid product for a dedicated userbase who can access its potential and implement strong processes and workflows. For the casual user if not clearly defined what to do can get lost in the sauce of the program and get overwhelmed. 

And upgrade or redesign of the UI/UX would be a great improvement especially if targeting broader applications. 

Was very useful in planning when multiple teams are using the same capital hardware (test equipment) and it has to be managed by multiple levels of priority and timelines. 
We can always track down who has used our assets, and we can make sure items are available when needed.
Don't trust these thieves at cheqroom. Way better apps out there. 
very good
