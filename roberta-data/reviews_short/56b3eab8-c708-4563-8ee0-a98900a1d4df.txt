I expected improvements from 10 years ago and it has not progressed.
Working with the staff has been overall very pleasant; every one of them has been kind and helpful. I enjoy using the software, and will likely continue my subscription. 
In general, I have had excellent experience with Means. I feel confident in their prices, wages and factors for various areas of the country. I live in Mexico so would love to have a Spanish version.
I have to estimate replacement cost on the components of a condominium that its  Association is responsible for. We usually don't worry about foundations, but roofing costs, asphalt roadways and parking, and a host of others - swimming pools, etc. are reported on. RS Means has fairly comprehensive listings in the books but I'm starting to use the online data more often now. The system is getting easier to use.
qty and price already "adds up". Too much time to create a system proposal because you need to add each line. Procore system contains a construction system layout with all its accessories synced as soon as I click the type of system to be installed.
