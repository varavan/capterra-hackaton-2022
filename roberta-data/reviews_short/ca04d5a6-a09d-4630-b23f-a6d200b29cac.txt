We were already running Influitive for our customers when I came on board. With the success of our customer portal, we decided to also launch it for our associates. We have generated case studies, videos, product reviews, referrals, references, etc.  via Influtive and has given us a chance to really get to know our customers. The success coaches I've worked with are awesome. They have helped us brainstorm campaigns, show us new features, and are quick to respond with support questions. We've had a great experience using Influitive and they are keeping up with the latest trends by releasing new integrations and features each month.

I was originally hesitant about making a bet on the Influitive software, as I was unsure about how our customers would respond to this type of loyalty program. Since launching, every day we see more value come from our program! Not only have we been able to attribute real bottom line impact to the software, but we've also increased the quality and quantity of conversations we have with our customers. I'm excited to see what's to come as we continue evolving our hub.
