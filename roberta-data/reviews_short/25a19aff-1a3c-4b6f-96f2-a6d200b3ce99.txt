I like the changes we are seeing in Escapia. I still have some baggage from their past communication practices (starting around 2018) that have given me a lasting impression of a "like it or leave" attitude. By this, I mean that they would make sweeping changes that felt at odds with their service partners, with little window for feedback or interaction, all while knowing that there are few better alternatives to their platform. They've improved their communication since 2018, but I still find myself unsure if their changes are for the better of their PM clients. I think they are taking the right steps, however, and my trust is being rebuilt in them.
Escapia has been a reliable and steady software that we have used for over 7 years now.  The features continue to grow each year, making it more robust.  There are definitely some features that are still missing, and "cross-feature" compatibility issues (for example the Lead Management System is not integrated very well with the actual reservation system and guest history). Improvements to the Escapia websites I believe are long overdue, as the layouts and functionality have been the same for many years now.  Support is typically responsive and will get back within  48 hours with an answer.  Overall, we have been very satisfied with the software!
I don't think I even utilized every possible feature.  It's a great product, but we just could not afford it.
