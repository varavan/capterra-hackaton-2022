Whenever I order online, i check if I can order it through honey to save money!
Just grateful to have it
This application is ok, not great.  I find it to be more hassle than it is worth, as it takes some time to run through the different coupon options, and when it does not work, the page resets.  I have only gotten something good out of it once or twice.
Overall it has helped (especially during a pandemic) to work remotely but still be connected with the team 
In the past we would not even know if there was a better deal out there so we would have to shop around and that took forever sometimes.
