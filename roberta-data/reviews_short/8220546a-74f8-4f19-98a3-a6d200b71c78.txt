What do you dislike?
-terrible terrible customer service. I asked my rep questions like how to add/delete items, access multiple tables and pre-authorization, he recommended me just to google it. blocked my number after i texted him questions.

-unreliable devices: 2 ipads freeze on the first day of use

-long processing time, and the processors will turn off here and there, we have to turn on, waited till it synchronized before taking payment.

-can't pre-authorize effectively. the function is only available for bar tabs, not on tables or bar seats, very confusing for food runners.

-we switched to another system within 4 days of use, and they billed me for $14,000, i am still stunned...i rather pour that money down into the drain

-over-promising, under-delivering. my rep sold me so many functions on the features when they can't even deliver the basics.

i'm a bar owner for 7 years, and this is the worst POS i've deal with. DO NOT TRUST what they say!

fine dining and traditional restaurants, staff have the ability to bring the POS system to each table
I am not one who usually shares my experience when it's bad but I am leaving these reviews in hope that TouchBistro will reach out to me so I can resolve some issues.  We purchased the system and went live back in October of 2019 for our new restaurant.  The interface looked good but as far as the system being customizable to whatever you want it to do...It's not that.  During our time the system lost orders,  had issues updating the menu from the cloud to the POS and ultimately cost us around $750.00.  The card readers continue to lose connection,  the printers print to different locations randomly, and when the POS updated,  it messes up because the Main Hub has not updated yet.  We have a fairly small location so to attach a screen to our iMac Mini every few days is pretty challenging and if we don't,  we start shift with these problems.  That is what lead me to look for another POS and we found one that is far exceeding our expectations.  Toast has been amazing!  I called TouchBistro to cancel and the rep stated that he would send me an e-mail of cancellation and someone would reach back out to me to finish it up.  I was on hold for around 1 hour and 20 minutes the first time I tried to cancel.  I did get the e-mail but no-one ever called me back to wrap this up.  Today I tried to reach out and was waiting on hold for 42 minutes before getting a rep who said he had to transfer me to the care team to get everything done.  I was transferred,  waited for about 15 minutes on
