We use this for everything... group messaging, pushing announcements, contributions, event calendar, church directory, etc
Much better organization in the office.  A tool to connect church members, and assist church leadership.
We are always finding new ways to use Realm to help us in ministry.  We are looking forward to inviting parishioners to connect online. 
The biggest benefit by far was the cost savings and not losing much of the functionality.  We are a small congregation and being able to reduce the monthly cost of our software but still maintain the level we were accustomed to was huge.
