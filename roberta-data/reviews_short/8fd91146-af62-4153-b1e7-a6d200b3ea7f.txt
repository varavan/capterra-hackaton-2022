I have been able to increase my on time payments with online payments and also the ability to invoice parents who have not paid and owe balances.
We were using a competitors software,  decided to change to EZcare. It was the best thing that we did. Billing is so easy, saving us so much time! We can customize Reports to have the info we want on them. Overall the software saved us time which saved us money.
I love being able to access EZCare from anywhere. Before we went to the online version, I couldn't answer any questions or check anything unless I was at my work station. Now I can be at home or at someone else's computer and find out what I need.
This software allows the seamlessly integration of database, accounts receivable, payroll and payable.  The ability to e-mail all families and have them pay on line has increased our cash flow.   I always receive a call back when I am stumped and their client service is A+.  We actually bought our hardware because it could run Ezcare.
