Cognito Forms is an Easy to use online form application, but for more pro users it has a lot of extra functions almost like Excel. Customer Support is Awesome!
Great overall experience!    I am not joking.   These people are doing it right.  I hope Microsoft does not buy them up.  I plan on staying with them for a long while.

It's free plus unlimited everything. I love this app!
Very easy to use, wonderful UI and no lags while building the form.
So glad i found Cognito!
