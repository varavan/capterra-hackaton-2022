North Beach Village owns and operates over 30 boutique hotels, totaling 500+ rooms, in the Ft. Lauderdale Beach Area.As investors and not hoteliers, we really needed some guidance when it came to figuring out the best way to run our separate hotels as one large, resort style village.  We knew we wanted a user friendly system for the staff but also wanted something that was sophisticated and could grow with our always expanding needs. FDA did not let us down!The cloud based system is ideal, as we move our reservation desks a lot.Options such as color coded reservation types (group, wedding etc) have let us easily prepare for the arriving party. Multi-property, yield management and channel manager options have enabled us to maximize our bookings and thus increase our profits. FDA has been with us every step of the way, providing everything from marketing suggestions to technical support.Their suggestions and support have helped to greatly improved our revenue stream and reputation.  
We are a small, seasonal mom & pops motel in northern Michigan.  Frontdesk Anywhere meets all of the needs of our seasonal business; finding a good seasonal program had been a challenge.  The agents from Frontdesk are always  very responsive and our reservations have increased more than significantly since our partnering with them.  The program is very user friendly and meets all of our needs!!
I only utilized the demo package before switching to another software. However it was not due to disliking the product at all!
Aside from difficulties with customer support (Not fully staffed in my opinion), the product itself is great.
good. I'm satisfied with your product.
