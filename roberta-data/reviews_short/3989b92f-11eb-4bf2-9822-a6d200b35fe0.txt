Whenever I have a question and submit a ticket, I get a very fast response from Customer Service. Makes life easier!
Cosmolex does it all!  Using Cosmolex has enabled our small law firm to enter time and billing on the fly, keep track of appointments, stay on task and balance the accounts -- no missed billable opportunities by either attorney or assistant, and it has dramatically increased our profit margins.  The accounting features are invaluable, especially for trust accounting, and the dashboard features gives you an up to the minute overall firm snapshot.  Customer support is fantastic and they offer on demand training and webinars, which are very helpful!.   AND, the best part is it is AFFORDABLE!!!!  
I needed a practice management program to make my practice more efficient. I researched the top programs and found that Cosmolex provided most of what I needed. During my trial period, Cosmolex was great about answering my questions and helping me learn about the program.
I was starting my own practice and wanted to be as mobile as possible. I wanted to also find something that is cost-effective and full service to keep my overhead low. CosmoLex is cloud-based, reasonably priced, and includes full accounting software.
Good
