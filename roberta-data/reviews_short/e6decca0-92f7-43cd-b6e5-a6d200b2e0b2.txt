great experience so far , except those small issues with the separate emar app.
The best thing I can say about Best Notes is the support I received from the technical team. They are ALL EXCELLENT, very helpful and super professional!
I am able to move quickly through a note while I am with a patient with very little effort and this allows me to focus more on the content of the appointment, and less on charting.  My patients are navigating the patient portal with ease, and I love the way their answers to questions during registration auto-populate into the note!  The combination of comprehensive content, and the feature of integrating DSM-V criteria into my diagnosis, makes my note look amazing!
Best Notes allows me to do my job with efficiency! 
after a short time of training i was able to use best notes quickly to perform my job
