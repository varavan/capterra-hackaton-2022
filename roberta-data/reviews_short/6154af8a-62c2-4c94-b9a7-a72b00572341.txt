I have been a Compulink EHR user since 2006.   I chose this software because it is easily customizable to your practice.    The software is very easy to program and use.   Over the past 10 years I have been extremely pleased with the software.   
When we can establish connection, this product works well. My only complaint would be how often we are unable to establish connection. 
I have used multiple EMR systems in the ophthalmology setting and Compulink is in a league of it's own. It is very efficient, user-friendly and easily adaptable to various work-flows. The help desk is very responsive and goes out of their way to figure out problems in the most time efficient manner.
