Happiness - 4 / 10
You get what you pay for.  Unfortunately, better solutions are WAY more expensive.  I haven't seen anything that is a little bit higher cost, and a bit better.  Only a huge leap, high cost.  So we feel stuck and unhappy.  

Additional users adds WAY TOO HIGH monthly cost.  $30USD per user...  PER f'n month!  You do everything yourself.  But now an extra person can log in.  Zero difference in productivity.

5 users, 3 years = over $11,000 canadian dollars.  
(assuming the exchange rate is 1.25 with no fees...  reality is probably more like $12,000+CAD.)  
Is that too much?  not if productivity is improved and the need is served.  But productivity is not improved, and frustration comes along more than it should.

At no point have I felt like this is making things better at a good cost.  Period.  Needing any chat help is a swift reminder.  

Sometimes updates break user permissions or products you've spend time to customize.  
Since you have to customize everything yourself...   When they break it, they don't understand how you customized it so they can't or refuse to help constructively.  A potato / pot-ah-to sort of argument where the 'helper' is a stubborn jerk.  nice...

Docketmanager is superb but expensive for a small shop.

Printlogic is functionally great in my quick testing and better fit for paper printing but the interface has a long way to go.  It's also on europe time for service.  Again..   get what you pay for.  price is right for a small shop.
