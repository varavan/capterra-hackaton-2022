Started using the Data-Forma system in 2009/2010.  In a lot of ways it helped us track our work orders, provide clients with an easier way to share info versus a DropBox or related service.

However, all the benefits of the service have been lost by failures in customer service, addressing customer concerns and simply even returning a phone call.

Like all vendors in the construction industry, they make all kinds of promises to get a sale and are very attentive until they get your check.  Then it's on to the next sale and you are old news.
We started using Dataforma in the fall of 2008, and have not regretted a moment of it. With Dataforma, all of our information is in one spot and we can log in from anywhere, better utilizing our time. No more searching for paper - we are just a click away from our data. Our entire office uses it, We only use the basic functionality of Dataforma, but it keeps us organized and focused on what we do.

Dataforma is easy to use, and captures everything a roofing contractor needs to be successful. It truly has been the best tool for our organization.  And in addition to the product being top notch, the Dataforma team is tops too. We cannot imagine running our business without Dataforma!
It review was easy to navigate through.
