Overall experience has been good with the exception of integrations.  Hopefully this will improve.
Generally, Aloha is an awesome programming to utilize and suggest it.
I used aloha for 3 years and I liked it 
We use it at the restaurant I work at and during the holiday seasons it is easy to find names and orders.
