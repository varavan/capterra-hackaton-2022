So far the software has been extremely user-friendly. The customer service is outstanding as well as the site has an easy to learn format.
It has been a good experience
Simplicity and ease of use.
I initially signed up with FMX after 6 years using a competitors product.  I noticed right away that FMX was easier to navigate and had a more intuitive program.  In addition, the FMX team welcomes feedback to drive change, the program that we initially signed up with did not include a Purchase Order suite of tools.  I told the team that this was a must have!!  They promised that they would be able to get something going within the first year and worked with us on an initial design.  While the PO program is still lacking a few features that I think would be helpful for us, they delivered on schedule and I know that they are working through the changes that will make it even more valuable.
I recommend this program to anyone who expresses any kind of a need for a product of this type.
