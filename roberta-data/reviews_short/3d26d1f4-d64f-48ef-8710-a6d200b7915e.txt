The way that we can see our group on a timetable and where they should be when is incredible. Settles not understanding what area they ought to be at. Gives incredible ETA.
The migration process is terrible.  Took months because they are backed up and they had a lot of limitations.  If you are importing a large business, expect LOTS of mistakes and several months of transfering stuff over.  Sales support was strong during the sales process and they have a decent tutorial/article look up system.. but lots to be lacking.  You'll end up calling them for a simple.. "how do I mass move appointments".. and you'll be met with a 73 step process which takes 2 hours to complete.
