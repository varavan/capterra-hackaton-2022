For this type of product, I would call the overall experience excellent.  I can’t think of any other package that I have not considered abandoning within five years, other than perhaps GSuite.  I have never had downtime and 5he system meets our requirements.
Easy way to provide information confidentially. 
Mostly very positive 
Excellent, and well worth the cost.
Overall I’m satisfied with Onehub but I’m disappointed that other then the app there has not been major improvements in functionality of the desktop and that the iPhone app doesn’t at least do what the website can.
