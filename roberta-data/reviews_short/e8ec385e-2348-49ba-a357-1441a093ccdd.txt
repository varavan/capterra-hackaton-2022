Great system and great customer support.
I monthly like its easy of use and amazing large community who built plenty of themes and plugins which makes any task easy for users. To regularly update themes and plugins  manually. I have to take backup regularly.  It is very nice.
We noticed with our old system that many of our estimators were spending time running reports for operations instead of estimating cost for new work.  FASTDUCT immediately removed that waste because it creates all reports natively in Excel.  We also noticed that the way to setup specs for duct were MUCH more streamlined in FASTDUCT than other products... you could tell the developers had sheetmetal experience.
Outstanding when you add up all the benefits. I'll never stop using it.
FastDUCT overall is an excellent choice to make if you want speed and detail. The price is also very reasonable
