Overall we moved to WorkWise ERP to cut costs, gain some functionality, and have direct access to our data. They delivered on all of those needs. At the time of implementation we thought we would be able to use their manufacturing system, but found that with us being a custom job shop with variable processes and materials their shop floor and job cost system is not flexible enough for us to use effectively. But, because the system is built on SQL Server we have the ability to easily tie a costing system built for our industry into WorkWise ERP. 
Our overall experience with Workwise has been positive.  We had a slow implementation, our first PM was not very involved or proactive and we had inexperienced members on our internal implementation team.  We felt the discovery process was disorganized which delayed a  thorough understanding of our business needs and clear articulation of how our business needs translated into system use. However, our implementation consultant always makes and takes time and help with whatever we need and has always been very helpful and accessible.  We have received a lot of support from management to resolve any issues and concerns we have and to provide additional resources when needed. 
There seem to be a lot of bumps in the road as we progress further into the software. We are still struggling to get all of the information we need, in and out of the software.
