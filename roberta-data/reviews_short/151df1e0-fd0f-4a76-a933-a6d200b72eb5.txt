Receiving and importing multiple customers' orders quickly and efficiently. We benefit from using TrueCommerce by mitigating entry error and speeding up processing time for our customers.
Implementation Staff are slow.  Partner to Partner setup within their own environment.  Tools to change mappings yourself do not exist for the most part.  Those that do exist are dependent on the previous tier and (as I have recently discovered) can be confusing (2 identical fields for item ID with no way to differentiate which to use, for example.  
Technical support is helpful for the most part when issue is relating to the use of the product but when it is a configuration issue it often takes 24 hours for an engineer to look at it.  Clearly, departments do not talk to one another.  Sales, Implementation, and Tech/Engineering do not always provide the same answers on questions.
