We are a boutique executive recruiting firm and have used Bullhorn for over 4 years.  Bullhorn was built by and for recruiters and it shows - the product is intuitive, user-friendly, and follows our natural workflow.  We went with the version that can be customized, which I highly recommend as it has allowed us to make tweaks specific to our business.   Customer support is outstanding. Anytime we have had a question or issue they have addressed it quickly and thoroughly.

It is a great CRM product.  The cons I have with it though are:
1) Limitations on 'report' structures - To get specific detail, we are unable to tailor ourselves and found that it costs extra to have one created for us
2) The new version only allows review of one tearsheet at a time.  In previous versions, I have been able to review multiple tearsheets.  
3) The refresh function closes a session and puts you back to the very beginning of a process.  For example, while removing candidates from a tearsheet and refresh is hit, you are no longer where you let off.  You have to find the tearsheet and sort again to specific criteria to be able to review. 
4) It would be GREAT if the LinkedIn messages could sync with the candidate record.  This function, to my knowledge, does not exists.
