Very satisfied with the software. Like I said earlier it is super easy to navigate and I overall love it. The experience has exceeded expectations. 
Love it
We have a small practice and weren't happy with the current software we were using.  We were looking for a software that wouldn't break the bank but would offer some good options and a great product.  Well, we found that with Kareo.
