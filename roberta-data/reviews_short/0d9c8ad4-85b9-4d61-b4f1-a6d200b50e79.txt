V.Good
One of the things I like most about Maxpanda work order management software is their customer support service. We had a few internal problems a couple of times and they are always available with the solution. They are very knowledgeable and direct. We really enjoy this work order management software.
 
This work order tracking software is great! Very easy to use once you learn the basics. The program fits our needs perfectly and the customer service is fantastic. I think the mobile app is a really good idea. I run my work order tracking software on an iPad whenever I am not at my desk. 
Ability to check each of our Buildings, Vendors and/or Locations.  singularly.

Ability to retain images in the Cloud per Work Order
This hotel maintenance software is user friendly and flexible. We have found the customer support service to be very helpful and responsive in getting issues taken care of quickly. The help files and videos were also very helpful when setting up. Awesome hotel maintenance software!
