Generally pleased with Crelate, customer service is excellent.  Product is sophisticated and can appear complex.  We are a two person operation and therefore do not use many of the features which would be of benefit to a larger office envionment.  We are still a bit 'dogged' with client duplications and loss of client phone numbers from the migration.  System has been 95%+reliable
Crelate has been very easy to transition to, and customize for our needs. I like the job view to see how many candidates are at each status in the process. 
We use Crelate for our ATS and it is a much more user-friendly application than our prior one. I think it has amde us more efficient as a whole. 
The value for the price of an annual license is beyond incredible.  This is my go-to ATS every time!
