I appreciate the easy to use interface of paycom. I can use it on my iPhone and desktop. The features for clocking in and out are easy to find. I have enjoyed also getting to see in real time how many hours I have worked and my leave time. There are also features to track mileage and upload expenses for reimbursement.
We use Paycom for our payroll and HR processes across our entire organization.It allows easy access for all documentations. It is an amazing HR platform.
