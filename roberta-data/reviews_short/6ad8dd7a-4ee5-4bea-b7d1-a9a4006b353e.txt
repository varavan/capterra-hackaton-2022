In summary, easy learning curve with multiple sources of support, the team responds quickly, and constantly updating features. Recommended to any recruitment team.
We've been using the platform for over 4 months now. It was very easy to implement and get everyone started. Overall I can say it really has helped us improve our general efficiency and keeps all our work well organized.
