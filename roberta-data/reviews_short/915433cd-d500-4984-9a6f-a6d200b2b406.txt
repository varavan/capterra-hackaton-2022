I have been extremely impressed with my first campaign in 2017-2018.  I also was delighted at how easy it was to re-engage in 2021-2022 for my current re-election campaign.  The technical difficulties thus far, I have had great customer service support.  I am very pleased with Anedot. 
The software allows church members to contribute to the church without actually being on site. A very important feature due to the present Covid-19 situation.
I will quit using them as soon as this campaign is over.
