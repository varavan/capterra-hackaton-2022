ContractSafe staff have been very helpful with start-up and transition from our old system.  They are always available when I need them, either via email, phone call or online chats.  They have also made an edit that I requested, which is nice to have them be so flexible.
ContractSafe has allowed us to centralized a variety of agreements organization-wide. Having one central location for all of this information is critical for sound business operation. 
We needed to store our agreements in one secure place for an organization that has multiple departments and storing choices. It has been great to promote this for all departments, and to provide a way for teams to get notified when contracts are up for renewal, have issues or expire. 
We had been searching for a method to convert our paper routing and approval process for all of our contracts for many years.  We attempted to solve the problem with a customized product tied to our accounting software and that effort was a miserable and expensive failure.  Contract Safe was literally up and running within a day and we customized the product ourselves to meet our needs.  Customer Service is incredibly responsive to assist at any time.
