I love it. I get frustrated sometimes but the support is excellent and usually makes thing okay agin very quickly.
It's been great. The product is early to learn and easy to use. Customer support is quick and helpful. It's my favorite WordPress plugin.
My experience with Formidable Forms has been straight forward and smooth. The fact that i can build any form with it makes my work much easier
