Turbo Tenant is a great program. I have recommended it to many people.
My problem: Having an electronic application that ties into a user friendly app that I can make decisions on based off the credit/background check. 
Your software helps to connect landlords and tenants together allowing landlords to make the right decision on who will rent their home(s). 
I first tried out TurboTenant last year, when one of my rentals became available and was quite impressed! Since, I have used TurboTenant for all my vacancies. I find it's simple to use right from my smart phone.

Good tenants in my rental properties
