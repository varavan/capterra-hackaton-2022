While researching various alternatives to the standard 'job board-centric' recruiting services, I came upon RecruiterFlow through LinkedIn.  After a brief discussion with [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN], I decided to go for the free trial.  With hands-on assistance from [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN], including lots of emails and calls, we set up several posts on the site.  I am thrilled to say that within about 2 weeks of my first post, we had a preliminary interview, follow-up interview and placement!  As soon as our trial was over, I signed us up officially. Looking forward to continued success.  
Great especially the team. If we have any questions they help us and even customise the software for us.
Made our recruiting process much easier
I need to use the email template and drip campaign function more.. Good for keeping everything in one place and assessing my pipeline
