Efficient, trustworthy software that impresses patients with that trust and integrity. 
I am really glad I made the decision to start using the platform! I am horrible with administrative tasks and like to keep everything as simple and easy as possible. I have been able to incorporate video sessions into my practice without needing to add a separate platform and everything is integrated into one place.
For the last couple of weeks I have been loading my client data and billing into SimplePractice. While it was difficult playing catch-up, I also got a sense of how helpful the program will be.  I have been able to familiarize myself with the program and I find it to be graceful and straightforward. While I can't speak to the insurance billing, the cash/check payments and invoicing is very useful and has become easier for me the more I have used it. This week will be the first week that everything is loaded and ready to go and I'm actually excited to be able to take payments, enter notes, and schedule session with such ease. I have been recommending to colleagues that they get their trial period started before their first client so they can teach themselves how to make things work with sample clients and be ready to hit the ground running when the actual clients come through their door. I think the videos and other customer support is great and I'm happy knowing they are available even if I'm more of "try it on my own" sort of person. Overall, I'm pleased that this program was recommended to me because it has brought ease and security to my practice.
better ability to manage multiple areas of my practice
