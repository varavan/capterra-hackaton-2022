We move the active phases of our projects into this app for management using kanban. We also use it to assign tasks to individuals, keep a company calendar, store commonly used files there, have a company manual, and it logs our chat on Zoho Cliq. It is currently the central hub of everything we do.
The platform is incredible, it allows teamwork to facilitate the development of projects.
I like to use this application to enter my violin classes
