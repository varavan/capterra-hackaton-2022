It does what we need with a minimum of the things we don't.  It's really quite accurate with importing data, parsing resumes, the search function works very well but working with the results list can be quite cumbersome and repetitive.
BB is such an upgrade to the FileMaker system we used previously. However, the parsing of jobs is slow and a lot manual cut/paste.
And, as mentioned, lack of the audible reminder is a hindrance to my desk, personally.
Tech Support is friendly and VERY helpful, particularly [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN]! He's my guy!
Fantastic ATS, Fantastic support.
Excellent.  I used another well-known platform previously and was disappointed.  Big Biller is a valuable tool.
I couldn't run my business without it. It's a simple way to keep track of 1,000's of candidates.
