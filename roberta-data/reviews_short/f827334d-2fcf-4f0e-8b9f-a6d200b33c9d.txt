StreetSmart is used to collect field data from our fiber optic installers. While it's customizability is very useful and the default options handle most of our needs, the software is still fairly poor quality and is a pain point for our installers. The customer service is very good, and our representative is always available for questions and assistance inside the app. 
Great
Overall,  StreetSmart is a great tool.
Time tracking and time-stamping by location is key.
Easy to use
