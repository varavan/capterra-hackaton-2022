I would say that this would make a great backup solution for a small office. Very easy for the end user to have backup their files in the background. For the administrator, a little bit more work to set up than I would like.
Great technical support from their team. Easy install on Linux. Ability to offer historical backups. Detailed reports. Low cost which is a huge plus.
Las copias son seguras, rápidas y fáciles de configurar. Me ha salvado los datos en 3 ocasiones en ataques  de Ransomware.
We use it for our managed backup clients and ourselves and it has been a great addition to our service offering.
We use the product to protect against ransomware, to maintain backups at a second site and to minimize our Recovery Time Objective (RTO).  The fact that the server software can be installed on a NAS or a linux machine has the potential to make it a very economical solution for business.  The licensing costs per profile are quite low and very competitive.  My highest priority was to have a backup system that did not rely on windows file sharing and could be placed on a separate domain or behind a transparent firewall for maximum protection.  Syncrify achieves those goals.
