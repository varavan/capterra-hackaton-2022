We eventually had to switch, AGAIN, to a different software but while we used this we had no complaints!
It's great for what it is.
I highly recommend Donor Perfect.  We are a small non-profit and were using Access on a limited scale.  It was tedious and frustrating.  We researched over a dozen other software packages before we chose Donor Perfect for several reasons; 
1. Customer service (my sales rep was amazing and left all the other software sales reps in the dust when it came to follow-up, friendliness, patience and willingness to accommodate our software needs)
2. Software content and user friendly approach
3. High rating in customer satisfaction
4. Price-Donor Perfect is a very affordable option for a small non profit and offers a huge return in donor management.
I am a brand new Donor Perfect client and I'm still learning the ropes, so I can speak firsthand about how superb the tech support is. They are patient and quick to respond to questions (usually within 24 hours).  The learning curve can be challenging and nerve wracking, but I know I'm in good hands with Donor Perfect software and it's staff.
