Wonderful experience  at least it works just like wiggio and am happy i am making things happen
Hugely simplifies management of our association.
The support from the IT team is the best I have ever come across
We decided on member planet (competitor) although is very cumbersome and extremely busy dashboard but at least has the features we want. If TidyHQ solve some of above issues, I will jump right on it because simplicity is very important to me.
