I would like to say that my overall experience with the RCM at charm was good but [SENSITIVE CONTENT] was the most responsive and knowledgeable representative I worked with. I asked her if I could give her a review becuase I was so impressed with her performance.
You'll have to take my praise with a grain of salt since I really haven't tested it out in a real-world setting, but the set-up couldn't be easier. Plus, with it being free for users with less than 50 patients/mo (Vs 900$/mo for some HORRIBLE EHRs I could mention), it's very low-risk to try out. I'm literally finding more things to love about it by the day, which is something I thought I'd never say about an EHR. 

I will be subscribing to the telehealth service, which for $20/mo is a freaking steal! I know I should probably have waited to write this review, but I've never been in love with an EHR before.

I recommend at least opening an account and futzing around with it.
