The Nextech team is continually working on improvements and upgrades, and the community portal allows all of us to request new enhancements and also to vote on enhancements for the next release.
As a Practice Manager I am extremely frustrated with their customer service and technical support. When our EMR was down it took 3 days for Nextech to solve our issues, they kept blaming it on our internet service, firewall and email server but after 3 days thanks to my IT people they realized it had to do with their security records. Their inability to manage their own security records cost our practice additional expenses.  I will update my review once I receive my data, I will add a timeline of the whole data request process so other practices can use it as a guide. 

Our overall experience with Nextech Intellechart Pro and Nextech Cloud PM has been very positive. Having seen the competitors in our field, we have not regretted our choice one day.
