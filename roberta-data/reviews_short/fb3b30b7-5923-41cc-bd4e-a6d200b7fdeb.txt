I've used the free version of timeclock wizard for about 1 1/2 years and I give it a high rating in all categories.  I think it's a great tool.  I am however a small business and I feel like their new pricing model has priced me out of the system.  Yes I can still use the basic version for free, which is just that, very basic.  I think it's a great service and I wouldn't mind paying for it, but I believe the pricing model is far too high, or maybe needs additional levels.  I think a 3 user pro version for $9.95/mth would be easier to swallow as a small business and still provide them with the paid model they are looking for.  To go from using the software with access to all features for free one minute to having to pay $/mth for the same use is absolutely ridiculous.  It's just not a viable solution for me anymore. 
I have saved a substantial amount of money from not overpaying employees for time not worked. So the program more then pays for itself
This is great! At the beginning it is a little overwhelming but once you get used to it it is awesome! As well the customer service reps are really helpful and comply with my every needs! Thanks!
Time Clock Wizard was a breeze to use, way better than the old school way of collecting hours, each employee sending me a marathon text of hours and locations, ugh. Thanks Time Clock Wizard for making things easier for me!
