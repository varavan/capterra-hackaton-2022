The best!
I have used many programs in the past for handling service requests in the service side of commercial roofing and have not been impressed with any of them.  I clicked on  the trial for Razorsync and after an hour, knew that this is what i needed.  The simple interface, the customization of forms, and the overall speed is well worth the minor costs monthly.
