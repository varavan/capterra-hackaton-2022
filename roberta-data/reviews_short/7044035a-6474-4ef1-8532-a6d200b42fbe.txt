I have been using GageList for about three weeks now and enjoy the efficiency the software brings on managing calibrated items through a factory and service personnel. 
Overall, the experience is excellent.  Unbelievably refreshing to call support and someone actually picks up the phone instead of an endless phone tree and elevator music!!  I can't stress enough what a positive vibe that produces, showcasing GageList's commitment to customer service and product improvement.  I'm impressed.
It was overall a decent experience.
