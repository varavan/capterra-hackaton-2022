Overall we are very happy with the system it is visually appealing and makes the search experience more intuitive and our customers and staff feel it is a much improved way of retrieving images. 
Working in advertising, one of the issues we face is storing, sharing and keeping track of all of the images we use for multiple clients on a daily basis. Image relay has helped speed up our work time on projects as it allows for us to move quickly when locating and pulling assets rather than having to hunt through our files and servers to locate. This also helps us in our estimates as well, and shorter project work time, means less cost to the client, something they always appreciate! 
Overall, Image Relay is a solid product and the interface is good.  Customer support has always been responsive and good. 
As I said above in having multiple properties with different overall approach our biggest win was creating a keyword library to standardize asset collection across our resorts.  It then provided a simple way to find what we or someone externally was looking for.  Created an efficient way to help our brands achieve goals through their visuals.
