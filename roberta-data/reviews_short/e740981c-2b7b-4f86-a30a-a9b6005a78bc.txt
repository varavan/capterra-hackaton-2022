We love working with ThinkReservations, as our guests find the booking engine very easy to navigate and book independently from phone conversation;  so many of our guests  book "on the fly" and find using our booking engine to be a breeze.
Think Reservations works on improving their product all the time. 
Overall: We did a back to back to back demo of 3 systems and Think was easy winner. We worked with them to plan a fast go live after we bought the business, and we were live 10 days after settlement. Training was easy, online support is available and phone/email support is fast and effective 
Several fantastic results for us using Think are:
1.  The seamless transition from our previous software to being live on Think was so amazing.  In fact, they were even able to load my database and history from the software I had even prior to our most recent.  I have records from many years back that I can use to better service my guests.
2.  The ease of training staff and myself (owner) on how to use the software.
3.  Most important for us has been the lack of "double booking" in this past year with the syncing of reservations and calendars from other channels.  This has saved me thousands of dollars. We still have a paper reservation book (for my husband) but the lack of errors has been wonderful.
ThinkReservations has allowed us to bring our bed and breakfast and it's website into the current century.  It has enabled guests to make their own reservation without waiting to see if it will be accepted or not.
