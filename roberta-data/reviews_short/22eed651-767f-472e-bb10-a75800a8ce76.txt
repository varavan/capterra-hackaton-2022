It is a very friendly platform
Very bad. Very sorry to leave this company, but we will like to really be able to use.
Rocket.Chat is a great tool to use for remote workers and remote groups. 
Overall, I have a good experience using Rocket.Chat. As a user and not an admin though, I think it's quite disturbing not to know where's the limit of my privacy. 
good user experience, no complaints.
