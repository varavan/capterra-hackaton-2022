Can't think of one. 

I have used Confirmit (18 years), SPSS dimensions (3 years), Survey writer (5 years), two different in-house proprietary software packages and Voxco is by far the worst.
Voxco has been stellar to work with and the survey tool is sublime.   The SAML authentication was perfect for our requirements.  
Voxco has given us the chance to tap into our customer bases quickly, efficiently, and effectively.  We are able to easily view what our customers' experiences look like and are able to action based on this feedback.  The data gathered from Voxco is used by our top executives to make educated budgeting and forecasting decisions.

We're thrilled with the relationship we have forged with the Voxco team and will always be thankful for the tools they provide and the support they offer.
