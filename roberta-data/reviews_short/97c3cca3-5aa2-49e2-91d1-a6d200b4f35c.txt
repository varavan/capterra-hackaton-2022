I like it very much. It saves me time for more things to do. Reservations are really easy to manage and track. I love the data I can capture from it.  This is my first use of this type of Reservation system, but I am extremely happy with it.  Works very well.
overall i am happy with this software, just a couple of little things i would love to see improve but nothing major.
I'm already looking for where I'm going to walk with my kids. The hostel has many opportunities and hotels, too, it gives me a lot of opportunities I love this app
