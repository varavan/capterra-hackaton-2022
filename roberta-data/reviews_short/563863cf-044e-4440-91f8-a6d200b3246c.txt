Pros: Relatively inexpensive, and does the job we need it to do

Cons: User interface is clumsy. The recent updates have definitely made an improvement, but there are still many lacking features. CATS is also not mobile-friendly, which is becoming imperative considering the amount of internet use that occurs on mobile devices.
CATS was rolled out to our company a little over 2 years ago and we've seen an increase in applicants and hires ever since! The simplicity of the system makes it very easy to use, especially when it comes to training new employees. Also, there are so many different ways to organize and extract information to view for future company improvement. But the best part is having absolutely terrific customer support. There has never been an issue unresolved. We speak to company representatives every time we call and have build solid relationships with each of them!
Is my daily tool. Great!
