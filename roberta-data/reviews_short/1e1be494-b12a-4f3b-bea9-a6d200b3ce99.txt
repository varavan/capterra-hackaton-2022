So far itâ€™s been working great. 
5 Stars! 
Wonderful! I am pleased..
I love it so far. I'm someone who likes straight forward and simple when I do things. They allowed me to set up my event, add a picture, write up a description, and gave me an RSVP button which is the most important part of me doing this event page. So I'd say they nailed it.
