This software its an add value for every Operation and maintenance companies
I understand I use the most basic functions of this program. Part of that is the lack of time to sit down and really go through every item on the drop screens, looking for the options I need to achieve my objectives. My thought has always been some of this could be streamlined from a programmers standpoint. 
Really like it. There are a lot of features that can be useful in our purpose.
