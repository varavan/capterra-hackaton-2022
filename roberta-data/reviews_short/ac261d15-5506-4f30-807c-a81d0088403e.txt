Overall I rate this product very high.  I get on a lot of various conference calls throughout my week and this tool is a necessity. 
I use LogMeIn daily for remote access and support of our workforce. It works really well and allows me to complete administrative tasks without needing the user to do anything. The pricing has gone up. I wish there was a lower tier for those that don't need things like the built in AZ. 
It has been a seamless tool allowing for reduced cost and less on sight management of problems. 
I am leaving them after using them for many years.  BYE BYE.. don't let the door hit you in the a$$ on the way out.
