CounSol is easy to use and the customer service can't be beat. Instead of calling for help and getting someone who doesn't know your account you get personalized service at CounSol. I love that I can email my assigned representative anytime and he's responsive and helpful. He knows my account and can easily help me with questions and changes. 
Very Positve, easy to use, easy to navigate
I was previously using a system that seemed designed for a much bigger practice. Forms were difficult to implement, and there was zero customization of the client registration form, meaning my clients were being asked to input a ton of info I don't need, a waste of their time and mine. I don't ask my clients to name their religion or pick from a list of marital status options that may not represent them (I specialize in polyamorous clients). CounSol had the best options for customization. I also got a dedicated account manager who helped me get set up and implemented my forms for me so I didn't have to hash it out myself. Clients are having a WAY better sign up experience, and the whole system is just a lot more intuitive. I've never had an issue that was not promptly and easily addressed. 
We implemented CounSol at the beginning of COVID when we had to transition from paper files to EHR to enable the continuation of our practice virtually during the shut down.  It was an incredibly stressful time and the support I received made it possible to completely transition to EHR in less than 2 weeks!  The system is so intuitive and it just makes sense.
