Not bad just needs a few tweaks
Having been forced into the BF environment in mid-2016, after creating and maintaining a WordPress website for years, I'm more than a little biased in my opinion here.  There have been numerous times when I’ve had to explain to coworkers and our clients that BF is no where near a 1-to-1 replacement for what we’d been using for asset and internal information sharing.  For what it’s worth, the feedback I’ve received about BF from our users is either negative or indifferent.  Most often folks have a hard time using search to find what they need as they were accustomed to navigating a robust website to find what they needed.  It’s been interesting to see the UI changes over the past 2 years and they’ve certainly improved in my opinion.  I understand how much larger companies—that perhaps only service one type of client and have a large public footprint, would greatly benefit from BF.
Great, can't fault it!
