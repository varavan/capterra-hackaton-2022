HippoFM has made the Engineering department at Verdugo Hills Hospital an efficient working force. We had to find an affordable solution that had the ability to meet all of our requirements when we decided to in-house the Engineering department. HippoFM not only met but exceeded every requirement we put forth. From start to finish the project was smooth, hassle-free, and professionally done. All of my questions were responded to quickly and solution presented and implemented. I would recommend HippoFM to any facility.  
Everyone here is so far impressed with the capacity of the program, and its potential. We are still getting set-up with things and havent fully used it as we have been closed, so our review may be a bit premature. 
Seven facilities and 300 employees for an auto dealer were exceeding the ability of a patchwork system of what was done, was it done on time, and where the money went. We do not begin to use it to its potential, but the perceived vast abilities and good customer support were not what made us choose Hippo. 

Last year, I demoed a handful of programs and found many that were both less capable and required much more work to navigate. You do not need to be a Frequent Flyer Subject Matter Expert to be able to use Hippo. 

We all have other duties as assigned, but Hippo is certainly not yet another problem to solve. It is an opportunity we will keep growing into. 

Our only nit pick so far is not being able to readily show either salvage value for old equipment removed, or a lump percentage credit for paying a particular detailed invoice early.
