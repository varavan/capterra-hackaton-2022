Overall, the experience has been very good.  Implementation was easy and the support was excellent.
Iâ€™m very happy overall and customer service/support are very good - the tech folks are knowledgeable, patient and kind.
I love this company.  I've been with them from their initial start in our field of music schools, and they have developed very quickly.  They still have a feel of a small company, and I feel like if I need an aspect or tool developed, I have a pretty good chance of being heard and considered.
