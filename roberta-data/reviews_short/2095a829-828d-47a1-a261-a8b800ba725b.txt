Overall, I would recommend Fundraise Up to any and all nonprofits. Our donors love how easy it is to use and how nice the donation forms look.
We've been impressed by the Fundraise Up experience. Besides seeing an increase in overall donations, we've seen less abandoned checkout, increased monthly donations, increased mobile donations,  and increased coverage of transaction fees.

FundraiseUp has been a huge help and blessing to our organization. We cannot possibly say enough positive about it.
