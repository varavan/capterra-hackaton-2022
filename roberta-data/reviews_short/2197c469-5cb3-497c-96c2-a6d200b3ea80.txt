Estimating efficiency....once we were able to correctly adjust all price variables.
The man hours are close to accurate using factor 1, but the commercial factor bad. Overall it works but frustrates me as well. My business either thrives or dies using it.
Fast pipe is one of the good estimating software in the market, they are always upgrading the system and have training seminar( for a fee) but at least they try to bring the users up to speed.
