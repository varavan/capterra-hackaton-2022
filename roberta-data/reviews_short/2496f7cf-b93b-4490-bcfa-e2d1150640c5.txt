Love that this system is able to be adaptable to our specific needs.  There is always room for improvements or shortcuts, but that is in every EMR system out there.  Love the quick response/turn around time on any issues.  
I use AMD for billing and for scheduling.  The eligibility feature is very nice for insurance and we use that all the time. I do wish the patient date of birth was on the insurance screen. I contact support through Chat most of the time and they are very helpful.
AdvancedMD came recommended by Practice Fusion and the doctor trusted their recommendation. We use AdvancedMD's software strictly for billing. Their sales staff was amazing and wonderful and I love their support staff. They do a great job. The only thing I didn't like was that I had to manually put all the patients from practice fusion into the system. There was no easy way to pull all the patients in. The videos were somewhat helpful. 
Ease of access, customization, support services.
Implementation for the EHR and PM has been a challenge.
