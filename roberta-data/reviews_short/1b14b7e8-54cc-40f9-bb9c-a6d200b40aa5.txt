Verizon Connect is the WORST COMPANY I have ever dealt with in my life.  I promise this is not an exaggeration.  Most companies realize that if they give the customer a good experience they won't want to leave the contract. Verizon Connect's approach seems to be -- they are under contract so whatâ€™s the point of giving them a good experience?  

Do not sign a contract with this company!
Great software that can generate savings and improve productivity. Weigh the costs and benefits and decide if your company can make the move to Verizon Connect, you will benefit greatly.
Again when it works, I can see real time of what my drivers are doing and where my vehicles are.
customer support does not help except for asking you your email address, the company you are calling from and assigning case numbers.
You guys have been milking us on pricing and tech for a while. Not that we are interested in other company you are willing to reduce to try and keep us. We even have to ask about features we do not have.  If we could drop our service without penalty we probably would but your contract does nothing for the customer. If you had superior service and equipment at a great price, you would not have to worry about contracts.
