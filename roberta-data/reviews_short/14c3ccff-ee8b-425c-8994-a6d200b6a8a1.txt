A great product with good customer support and help for the non-profit community.
This was really easy to use and free for basic account. Excellent for students like myself who need to make surveys fast and easy for school projects. SoGoSurvey offers free upgrades for students which makes it even better. Thanks SoGoSurvey!
I am a doctoral student and frequently have to do research. Surveys are a great way to get information quickly and SoGoSurvey has the most attractive, easy-to-use format I've ever tried. People enjoy taking surveys because they are easy on the eyes and the design keeps them from being tedious.  I am also on the board of several non-profits. When we need to quickly gather data from our constituents, we can put together a SoGoSurvey in minutes and send it to a stored email list. I've recommended SoGo to my colleagues and many of them have switched to using it as well.
