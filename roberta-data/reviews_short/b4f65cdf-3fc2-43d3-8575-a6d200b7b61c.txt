One of our customers recommended AroFlo to us . His recommendation was based on the value for money and customer service.  We have found that the customer  service is excellent! All our enquires are answered without delay. This product allows us to carry out our business anywhere anytime, giving us to access customer details, drawings, schedule work and keep track of our employees and more.  This is an excellent business tool that could be used by any business no matter how small or large.
Very easy to operate and very easy to explain various aspects simply
From my first experience with Aroflo some nearly 3 years ago I have nothing but praise for the team.  Being from the sales department right through to the customer support team.  If we have an issue, we can normally reach the team on the first call.  On the odd occasion when I can, I email support and receive a response on the very same day. The team is very polite and in the main very knowledgeable. I have been working with two companies that I have brought on board and about to have a 3rd sign up in the near future.  The two businesses who are using Aroflo (one for nearly 3 years, and the 2nd for 9 months) are very happy with the improvements in their business.  This is both with the efficiencies and profitability.
I Decided to give Aroflo a go probably 6 or 7 years ago and haven't looked back. It was reccomended to me by a mate that had been using the software for a few years himself. At first I was worried that it would complicate things however I could not have been more wrong!! Aroflo makes my life so much easier and it had helped me to run my business more afficiently. I would reccommend Aroflo to all small one man show and large business.
