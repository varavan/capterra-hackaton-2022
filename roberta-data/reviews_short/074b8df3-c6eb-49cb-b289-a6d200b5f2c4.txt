my experience with Qooling is very good. helpdesk follow-up. usability top. If something is not there, it is always checked whether it is possible.
Qooling is always open to suggestions and improvements.
my experience with QOOLING, very clear and uncluttered, low threshold for the users in the workplace. good overview via the dashboard. progress and settled issues.
