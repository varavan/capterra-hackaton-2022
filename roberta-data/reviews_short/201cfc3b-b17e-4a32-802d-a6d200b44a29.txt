7+ years using this software and it's been a battle all along.  Then they create policies (such as, "You must be running on Windows 10 PRO - not the HOME version" THey use those policies to tell you it's not their problem when something gets screwed up (like their server being disconnected, or blocking you for security purposes ACCIDENTALLY!!  They won't even look into the problems if they notice you are not on the PRO version of Windows ... despite that it works fine on every other computer in your office on the HOME version.
I recommend reading the pros and cons list in the review section, before deciding if this software if for you.
I like it, because it make improving muy skills. 
Survey the market and play in the SANDBOX BEFORE buying.   This is a marriage.   It is very difficult to convert data
I took some time out of my busy day in the hopes so that my colleagues elsewhere will be spared of the unbelievable failure that is ECW.  Made by mentally retarded clowns, there is no no organization, no rational thought, no user convenience. It's just annoying, buggy, and spiteful (cancels prescriptions if you press Esc to close a drug interaction warning window, for example). Stay away from this worthless, outdated POS! Also Google the federal charge against ECW for shaky record-keeping that resulted in patient death!
