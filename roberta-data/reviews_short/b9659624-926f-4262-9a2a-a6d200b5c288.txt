Wonderful easy to use
As a church administrator who started as receptionist, I can attest to the ease of use and setup of Power Church Plus.  For those small-church secretaries out there who wear many hats, this software will help you streamline your payables and payroll.  Check it out!
PowerChurch has been used here at St. Barnabas before I was hired 18 years ago.  It has grown with us as we have grown, both in features and functionality.  But it has always stayed a quality product.
it is the best software that i have ever used. As I do the accounting process, powercruch helps me. it is the best software that helps in accounts of a non-profit organisations.
