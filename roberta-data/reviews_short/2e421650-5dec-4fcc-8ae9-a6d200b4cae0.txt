Wonderful! 
My experience has basically been good but not exceptional or fabulous. 
All our financial income is in one place, which allows us to pull reports and see all the data for analysis. We love how user-friendly it is and easy to use.
We have been easily able to track donors and do more effective outreach to those whole have given. Itâ€™s made things so much easier for us and continues to prove a useful tool.
