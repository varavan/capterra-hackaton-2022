It save us so much time as a Administrator in a Daycare, tax receive and another failures help the development in the centre, 
We have been using TimeSavr for a little over a year, and we find that it is easy to use, offers a lot of functionality, and allows easy billing and emailing.  The only downsides to the program are that licensing is not a fan of the attendance feature, due to the fact that attendance can be retroactively changed, and the sign in/out features are easy to bump, making accurate attendance harder than on paper.  
Before using this program I spent more time calculating and inputting children's attendance, but now with timesavr it makes it so much more easier by the touch of a button and it's done no more calculating,   We love love love this program 
I found the system easy to use , and flexible for correction. It saves time and paperwork. I would recommend it to others
