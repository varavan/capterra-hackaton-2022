The guests enjoyed a flawless experience with online bidding and donating. From a planning side of things, I loved that it was one less thing I had to worry about. It worked seamlessly, and each and every person I worked with was fabulous. 
I found BidPal to be exceptional not only in terms of checking in registrants at the event, but also  checking them out with their auction items. The registration process was quicker than it has been in the past and monitoring the auction and confirming participants winning bids helped keep things moving as the event wrapped up. Looking forward to possible integration with Raiser's Edge.
