Well, I am using FTP server for a long time to share files with other people, but since FTP is not secure and does not work with various platforms, especially devices such as mobile, and tablets. 
finally, we have tried to find alternative solutions such as dropbox but need to pay, but thank to our own cloud we can set up and use in our organization well, easy to share with other peoples outside the NAT, and can integrate with letsencrypt to increase more security.
My experience was good but our software developer moved us to NextCloud as he felt it had features that ownCloud did not. 
We are using it for our daily tasks for 2 years and I highly recommend this program for small and middle businessis 
The software is great. It does its job and it does it perfect. 
1. Good for Cloud Storage and Privacy.
3. No dependency on Google drive and other related softwares.
