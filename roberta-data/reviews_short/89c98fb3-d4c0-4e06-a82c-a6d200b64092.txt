It is a very useful site for me.
We are in the manufacturing industry where we are the only producer of calcined lime in our country. We have always used the Sage ERP system and decided to upgrade after many years. This is a great product for the small to medium size enterprise, as it can facilitate the needs of such an organization without robbing the bank.

The system can manage complex transaction and reporting capabilities are diverse and fulfilling with the optional fields module.
My organization deals with running elections, so we had a large volume of transactions to process during election time. We had to find a solution that would allow us to pay on time. We started using Accpac in 2002 and it has helped us a lot. It has made our lives easier, and our supporters have given us the full support that we need. Now we are using 5.6, which still meets our needs.
When they participate in other customers, there is a small portion of waiting and you need immediate help. The system saves time, is user-friendly and reduces duplicate data entry.
