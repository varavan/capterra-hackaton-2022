I really like it. It made our life much easier. I've put it in due to corona, but I will be using it after as well.
Bookwhen has been fantastic to use overall. There have been no issues at all. It has everything you need in a booking system when running courses. It's easy, simple and everything you need. Importantly great help from bookwhen staff!
I am so delighted every day we found Bookwhen. We were using Mindbody before and paying over £200 month, now we are paying £23 a month for a better less complicated booking system. It's so easy to upload courses, add extra dates etc.
The support is very good and fast email response, they even offer to call me when I'm really stuck
Great customer service and overall really user friendly and efficient and no issues so far.
My website looks organised and attractive due to the Bookwhen layout and I have become better at getting back to clients quickly as I can look up information for them on their bookings by accessing Bookwhen from my computer or mobile
