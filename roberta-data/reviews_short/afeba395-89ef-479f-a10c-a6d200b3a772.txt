I've been using ECWID for some time now, upgrades are frequent. The app store has a bunch of very handy add-ons. Great product!!
Very good, and yet to explore all the features.
I am very happy with the overall ease of use and professional look of my Ecwid store.  Support is fantastic. Ecwid is awesome!
My customers complain that the store is often slow and cumbersome to navigate. We have also noticed it loading excessively from time to time. I feel the price is a bit high per year on the full blown product. Especially in a business with only 30%markup. I don't like that I pay for the full version and then also have to pay for add ons to get everything I need. 
Selling my custom pen up on the web.  Start to see the effort pay off.
