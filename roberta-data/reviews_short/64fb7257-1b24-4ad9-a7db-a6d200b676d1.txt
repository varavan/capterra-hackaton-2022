There are several benefits our company gets from this software. It stores our jobs and details, our technicians use it to track where they are to go. We store special notes and comments that helps with invoicing. It helps the executives with gross profits margins. We track parts and labor hours and job details.
The previous company I worked for did everything 19th century style so I was really blown away with this product. Love the map aspect of it
I like that you can have multiple tabs open for convenience and multi tasking
Great software easy to use and so helpful.  The technical support is also top notch.  I am a technician, skilled in extinguishers,  kitchen hoods, and scheduling software.
We have been using Service Trade for 15 months and it has really transformed our scheduling and quoting workflow. We went form using 4 different systems to one. Going paperless and having a really smooth and smart quoting process has allowed us to provide our customers a much richer experience and streamlined our process as well
