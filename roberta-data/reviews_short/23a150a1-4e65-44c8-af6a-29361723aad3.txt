We were able to have multiple users with out them seeing what we don't want them to see.   Also it improved the reporting and bill paying process.  It has been great to have estimating incorporated in the program and the ability to export into excel.  Some parts however are very clunky and take multiple steps (such as entering info twice in change orders or having to create a job after a client.  It would be nice to click a button on client that creates the job automatically.   Grateful the capability to transfer between accounts was added, however the fact that I have to enter a journal entry to use the vacation time costs on my balance sheet when someone uses it in payroll seems a miss-step.    
Keeping track of business
So far we have had a good experience with using Sage 100.  
I use this product daily for two separate companies, it has been easy to use and functions well for our needs.
