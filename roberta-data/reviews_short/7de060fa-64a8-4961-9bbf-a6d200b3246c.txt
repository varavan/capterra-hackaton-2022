This is very handy and convenient. I dont have to worry about much other than focusing on my client and running trials. It can take a while to get use to. There is a ticket section to get assistance from the IT team for Central Reach but it takes a while to get a response to your ticket. Most thing HR could help me with. It also took a lot longer to get the flow of the trials without paper. You can only see 2-3 trials on the screen at once, so there is a lot of scrolling if your client has many trials. During this time of trying to find the trial you are working on, your client has now eloped. It's a balancing act, but it should only take a few weeks to find your groove. 
Central Reach customer service team is great! They respond within 24 hours and always have great recommendations. 
I very much regret this purchase and am even considering making a switch AGAIN despite the high switching costs.

I had a good customer success lead but she couldn't do anything to help the fact that we had a sales rep who over promised and could not deliver.
