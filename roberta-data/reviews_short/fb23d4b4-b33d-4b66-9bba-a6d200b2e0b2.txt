Bigcommerce helped our business to start with a webpage. The customer service is great and they are always open to new ideas. 
I signed up when they were fairly new to the market, and have seen the company change hands, grow, and make changes to the product. It's not been a perfect experience, but I've never really considered changing platforms because of any issues I've had.   At the end of the day, BigCommerce lets me run my site without having to think too much about the web-side of things. 
It does the basics well, but there are plenty of e-commerce platforms out there that outperform BigCommerce. In my experience Shopify is better than BigCommerce is every way. I even prefer WordPress with WooCommerce to this.
We realized we needed a larger, more stable platform for our 110,000+ customers and Big C was a perfect fit for our company.
