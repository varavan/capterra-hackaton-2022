We highly recommend Gym Assistant to anyone!
We use Gym Assistant at RomGym 8 Minute Fitness in Honolulu, Hawaii and have found it to be very comprehensive in that it has every feature you can think of or would need.  Each week we are finding different functions and features that the software enables us to do.  It is also very user friendly enabling our newest employees to use it.   It helps you keep track of your members' visits and payments.  It also tracks your revenues and projections.  Best of all, it makes sure that all of your member's payments are paid on time.  You can also instantly view and print out any type of report that you may want to see for virtually any situation.  The software is also very flexible letting you create just about any sort of membership plan for your members.  We would highly recommend Gym Assistant to anyone operating a gym!
My experience was amazing because of its user friendly accessibility
