From sales to service to day to day use no complaints here. More bang for your buck than any ATS I have used.
I have used ApplicantPro for close to ten years now with two different employers. I made sure to make the switch here at my current employer to ApplicantPro as soon as I came on board. Has all the bells and whistles needed comparable to the big name brand ATS solutions at about half the cost. Great service if and when needed and very easy to use. Most impressive is they do not rest on their laurels as they constantly strive to update and improve their offerings.
The only con I can think of is that more people are not aware of the product and how great it is. They should have much more market share!
Online one stop shop for the hiring process. 
The program is easy to navigate. Creating and tracking a job order is easy.  Viewing job applicants and updating status online is beneficial for both the employer and applicant.  
list all job orders, including those closed. Wish it would only list those that are open or maybe I just need to familiarize myself more with the program. 
We don't need paper applications! Yeah! Applications are easy to complete, from applicant's viewpoint. Submitted applications are eash to review, from HR standpoint. Highly recommended.
Would like to see better support to existing clients.
Simple to get started and affordable.
Weak on reporting tools.  Weak on programming and adaptability to customer needs.  Slow response to Help Tickets.
Wonderful customer service, but the ATS could use some work regarding functionality.

ApplicantPro has all the basic, necessary functions for tracking applicants plus a few extra nice touches, like text messaging options. It does the job well. It is more affordable than some of the bigger ATS packages I have used in the past.
Navigation is still a bit clunky - not completely intuitive for other users who don't use it frequently.
This system is very simple to work with. I like that customer service is very easy to reach.
Easy to Navigate. I like that the home screen offers a variety of options to search for an applicant.
Keeps timing me out. Not sure why at times that I am active on applicant pro, it will log me out unexpectedly.
As an HR department of one, ApplicantPro makes my job sooo much easier! ApplicantPro does so many things - from helping me create job postings and posting them to various job boards in one click to filtering and screening applicants and running reports. I went from posting our vacancies on each individual job board to posting a job in less than 5 minutes. I get notified via email when qualified candidates apply (but you can turn this feature off and just check the system periodically if you like) instead of dozens of individual applicants flooding my inbox.  Then the report feature---no more excel spreadsheets--I simply select the type of report I need in ApplicantPro. ApplicantPro has been a game changer for me.

It has been a great feature for our onboarding process. We have been able to eliminate a lot of paper. It's a good tool to use for communication among hiring managers.  One con is I wish there was a keyward search feature that if I am looking for someone with banking experience for example that it would pull only those applicants.   I do love the automatic reply emails that we have set up so that I am not sending out a lot of emails. 

This software is perfect for our needs, customization  available where needed!  We appreciate all the features that you can add on like pre-employment assessments and background checks.  Great value for what you get!
Applicant Pro is very easy to implement.  Once it is setup it just works.  Very simple for the end users in Human Resources.
Can be hard working with the post sales engineer to get the project rolling.  Once it gets going it doesn't take long to implement
The software is extremely user friendly.
Not viewing emails received from applies
It's a great software to use for screening applicants.
It lets you contact, rate,  and track applicants. You can make internal notes about prospective employees and alerts you if they have applied before. This saves time if you can see previous notes regarding an applicant who applies to future job postings.
It can be a little tricky to post jobs at first, but once you get the hang of it its easy.
I've used a variety of Applicant tracking systems and not only is this one the most user friendly and intuitive, the customer support is fast and efficient.  I am impressed!

Easy, intuitive
ApplicantPro has changed the way we've done hiring. Not only is it easy to use, the customer support is unmatched. I always get same-day response on tickets I submit, the chat is always available, and I can log in from anywhere. ApplicantPro also helps with our affirmative action plan-making reporting on hiring easy. I love being able to set my own questions and filters to have the super stars rise to the top. ApplicantPro is worth every penny.
The customer support, being able to rate candidates, set my own questions and filters, and make notes that are confidential to our company.
CRM functionality would be awesome...and a way to instant message candidates
I am thoroughly enjoying Applicant Pro thus far. I have been able to find a better quality of potential employees from which to choose and have been able to add 2 very promising people to my team as result I feel of my companies investment in Applicant Pro.  The way a person is graded and assessed allows for the interview process to be more detailed as a manager responsible for hiring effective people to make sure I ask questions that allow me to make a smarter decision about who I add to my team. 
Grading and Assessment aspect
for beginners it can be frustrating trying to navigate to the areas you need  to be in.
Easy, reliable and really makes my job easier on the recruiting and onboarding side
Everything about this product from ease of set up and use to haveing everything right at your finger tips. The customer service is very knowledgable and fast
Cant really think of anything other than from time to time the system does go down which can cause a delay in services and lost work time
AplicantPro made my job way easier and freed up my time for other HR responsibilities.
Everything is done from one portal.  Jobs are pushed out to any job board you use, templates are easy to create and save along with job questions.  Very easy to use!!
There are 2 views to the software. If you go under view jobs the layout is better than under the view applicants, wish they were both combined with all features available under one layout. People who don't use the software a lot can get confused.  Also, incomplete apps are in the reports section. They should be under applicants, just a different tab. 
I have used Applicant Pro for a few years now, and just recently it was one of the first things I added when I started my new job last year.  I love the way everything is in one place.  I can easily put our open position on-line, and it feeds out to the list of free job boards.  I can also choose to send out to fee-based job boards with one click.  All my managers can see the applicants, and all applicants are saved into the database.  And the reporting (which I used for the first time last year) for Affirmative Action cuts down on hours of my time.  I am a one -person department within a small bank.  I do it all - and this makes my recruiting function so much simpler, faster and streamlined.  With one click, I can also send the job to our state DOL, as well as our Veterans and People with Disabilities reps.  Anyone who has the authority to see an applicant can make notes directly on that applicant, and rate the applicant for future.  We have one position that turns over frequently (Teller) just because we have so many - and we can go right back to our notes on-line for those candidates who impressed us who we did not hire.  In short, it's one of the best tools I've used in my HR career.
Ease of use, affordable, ability to save candidates information.  Ability for other managers to use the data base directly, one click to send job out to multiple areas.
I find some recent changes very confusing - I think it was easier to use previously and I find myself  getting a little lost.
