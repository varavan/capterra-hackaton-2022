AdvancedMD's timeline for training and implementation was for their convenience rather than to meet my unique needs.
My trainer during implementation has been wonderful. She has excellent knowledge of the program, as well as how to best use it to meet my needs. She has been the redeeming factor in my AdvancedMD experience.
It was sold to me as being more specific to my situation than It's proven to be. It is geared more to medical billing than to mental health billing and the training videos reflect this. That has been disappointing.
AdvancedMD has done a superb job with their support team, I really can't say enough about their level of professionalism, expertise and willingness to go above and beyond to help with almost any situation.  I've used other practice management products and AdvancedMD is by far the most user friendly.
I really don't know where to begin with the Pros of AdvancedMD.  I might have to say the Video Training Library is one of my favorite parts of AdvancedMD.  It is a guide or a visual aid to assist any user in the practice by displaying and explaining how things work.  After any formal training a user may have questions or uncertainties with regard to posting payments, processing claims, adding demographics, etc.  With pretty much one click of the mouse or F1 you have access to training.  
The ease of use is another Pro to AdvancedMD, you don't have to be afraid to experiment or test different aspects of the Practice Management piece.  I like how the product has evolved over the past 5 years and their social media piece "NEST" shows their willingness to relate to a younger generation of users while making it user friendly for us old folks too.
I would have to say the reporting piece is lacking from an accounting point of view, and the idea that Advanced Insight is available at a per provider fee is definitely not the answer I want to hear.  The financial health of a practice can only be measured in numbers, increase the subscription to AdvancedMD and throw in Advanced Insight, it's a win win!
Move on. Sales tactics are more suitable at a used car lot.  That deal that expires at the end of business hasn't changed in a year.  Don't fall for it and demand a trial live.  Save yourself the time this product has no value today.  
Excellent help files though many are for previous version of product and need updating and in the end they are help for an inferior product.
There is no EHR.  Don't be fooled by cartoon demos on video.  Its actually just a word merge system build on Word 97 which you need to even update a template.  It takes hours of tedious work on MS Word to move anything to a presentable format.  Sales will tell you it does everything you need.  Don't believe me or them, ask for a live trial and see for yourself.   You wont get one, if they let anyone try it they would have no sales.  
Software easy to use, however when problems arise, which could happens, do not expect a quick resolution.
Since Tuesday, June 30th I reported a problem not being able to run report, by Thursday I spoke to one of the reps, who I requested a Supervisor assistance. I mentioned I received an email advising they were working  but problem still persists. So called back Monday, July 6th; Requested at this time to speak to a manager (not a supervisor) the agent who took the call, nicely advised me there was not Manager, neither a supervisor; Then I understood why issues takes so long or no attention!

The wiliness to go the extra mile, user friendly and videos.  This product offer several ways to learn the formate and/or how to setup the system.  It allows for flexibility and room for growth within small practices.
The limited ability for Mac! All function of this product isn't avialble for use on a Mac, which make it challenging to access if there is not a PC available.  
We started a virtual consulting business.  Our practice does not have an office.  Everything we do is virtual which means we need a company that can handle everything from medical record storage to telemedicine.  AdvancedMD is the whole package.  We wanted a program that can offer telemedicine, customize our forms for patients to fill out during and/or during an appointment, and electronic medical record storage.  After several months of searching, AdvancedMD is the only company that can handle all of these tasks.  Unfortunately, getting a hold of someone after the sale has proven to be quite the challenge.  There is no real management system.  There is a sales team that is supposed to lead you through this process, a process that I was promised would be speedy.  The day after the contract was signed and the money was given, my sales rep stopped answering calls and emails.  He had no boss for me to be directed to.  I just got the operator and sent to a different person each time I tried to call and see where we were in the process.  Each time I was promised a call by the end of the business day, I was the one who had to call and follow up.  After a grueling process of being finally put through to implementation, the gal who helped us set up the system was very prompt and friendly.  She was thorough and did a nice job of explaining the system and making sure we were comfortable using it.  Prior to this, I had written a poor review about AdvancedMD on another website because I could not get anyone to return phone calls or answer.  Accounting said my contract was held up in sales and sales said it was held up in accounting.  Another month went by.  Finally, someone reached out to me about my review.  I was on vacation and attempted to call back to discuss the matter.  I had also brought up the fact that I was promised a month free, but that month had been wasted getting the program up and running so I was not able to make any income.  Then,  I couldn't take appointments anymore.  I had been moved to an "inactive" user while my business partner still remained an "active" user.  I reached out several times about this.  I emailed letting them know that I was going to be contacting the BBB because I felt I had been wrongly treated.  I had a response immediately.  I was placed as a temporary "active" user.  I was told that I was only supposed to have one active user at a time.  Well, my salesmen assured me that we could add as many users as we wanted with no extra charge (the other reason I chose AdvancedMD).  I was told that if I removed my review from another website that I would be given the free month I was promised in the beginning.  I said I would do that, but I wanted confirmation that I would in fact be able to continue adding providers for no extra fee.  That was last Thursday.  I reached out again yesterday, Monday, for some kind of follow-up.  I also reached out because we were in the middle of two consults when one of us got kicked out of the program because only one user is allowed at a time, also something that we were lied to about.  My contact assured me that he would have an answer for me by the end of business today, Tuesday.  I followed up at 3pm when I hadn't heard from him.  It's now 8pm and I have yet to hear a single thing.  Unfortuantely, I signed a year contract and there are currently no other programs that offer all of the services as AdvancedMD so I am stuck.  I have never felt so mistreated by a company.
This program offers a highly customizable telemedicine and medical record storage program.  Unlike any of the programs I have demoed (and there were several).  If the customer service could catch up, this program would be unstoppable.  
Customer service.
Advance MD has put some real thought and commitment into their system
Great customer care and follow up. One of the few that cater to dental billing via medical providers
The cost is a little steep but well worth it.
Once you learn the software it is pretty easy to navigate.
There have been several billing errors in the last three months. None of which have been resolved. We are going on two months now. If I didn't pay for two months I guarantee my services would be stopped, but apparently refunding errors on the software side are not as important to this company. I have spoken to several people regarding this issue and not one person has resolved the issue or returned calls as stated. 
Extensive program. Eprescription is easy, Lab orders are comprehensive. Ifax feature available for sending and receiving faxes, Customer service is exceptional, you always get a representative that will try to resolve the issue while on the phone, Trainers for the software are knowledgeable and helpful. PM and EMR communicates and easy to use both sides. Verifies insurances 2 days ahead of the appointment automatically. Patient portal is available. Billing service is fast and reimbursement are quick. RCM team is amazing.
Too many clicking between pages. Inability to check "Reviewed" box on a summary page at once, rather have to go through different tabs to check boxes. Too many "OK" to click with eprescription. Scanner only "Twain" compatible. Have to go back and forth between tabs to review PMH, Preventative medicine, vitals and care team  
User friendly. Constantly improving. Support is awesome. They listen to their users.  Implements managers hold your hand through the whole process. 
Messaging is to cumbersome. E-fax would be better is we could search my patients name instead of looking at every fax. 
overall, this program has been a total disappointment. the implementation staff needs a whole lot of training. have not been able to assist in any of our issues
eprescription only functioning part of this program. i can not say anything else that is good about this software.
unable to transmit medicare claims. unable to transmit any J codes. the sales team is good at their job, as selling this product. claiming all that it does, but product is nothing short of a disaster. 
Very frustrating initiation process.  very expensive for a product that was not set up correctly.  customer service is garbage.  once you sell a kidney to get going, the practice management software works pretty well, but it can be slow.  
I was accustomed to the program by the time I took over the clinic.  just like anything, when you get accustomed to the program, it does what it needs to.
Far too expensive for what you get.  I had to cancel the EMR portion as their data fees are outrageous. Customer service is a joke.  It took over 2 months getting the service initiated (I only needed my name added to the current account, but they forced me to create an entire new clinic profile despite my clinic already having a profile, likely to charge me more).  The data conversion process is a joke, they charge thousands to transfer data, and none of it was correct.  historical office visits seemed to be created without checking.  most insurances were incorrectly input.  my NPI numbers and billing information wasnt done correctly.  It took me and my staff months and dozens of phone calls to get things corrected.  When I pointed out all of their numerous mistakes, the response was that it was MY fault for not catching it during the setup process. In order to fix it, they were going to charge me yet another thousand dollar initiation fee to start an entire new profile. So I had to manually re-enter every piece of data myself.  The overwhelming majority of customer service reps Ive encountered dont know what theyre doing, often just pointing you in the direction of articles or videos.  
The Practice management software has a robust reporting system. The Sales staff are very helpful in explaining each of the features of the product. They truly make a commitment to the client. 
Sometimes the customer service can take a little long to get all the answers. There is not much clientele around behavioral health services using institutional billing claims. Hence, the trainers may not be as astute on this type of billing. The scheduler feature seems to be mandatory but if you do not want to use it, what options can we create for not using it. 
The quick end of month process is the only thing I am impressed with.
The process in implementing this product. Form templates should be created for the physician by the company and not the employees as we are not computer programmers.
ICD coding=ease of coding. Converts diagnosis codes memorized (ICD 9) to ICD 10.
technical support varies too much in product expertise and demeanor see below
The business intelligence reporting feature is just amazing. It works perfectly for my organization.
 I find it difficult to navigate it on my phone. However, it works perfectly using laptop. It should be improved to support any phone navigation.
They will promise the moon and stars leaving you staring up at a black sky! I suggest you look elsewhere!
Instant eligibility checking, ability to access a patient’s medication history from insurance company with touch of a button, template customization is easy. 
Too many different ways to do the same thing making it convoluted. Not at all user friendly or intuitive. Clunky. Hiccup after hiccup. Horrible mostly non existent tech support. Lots of errors and failed rx transmissions. Impossible to easily print a note or part of the chart! It doesn’t format to print without first creating what’s called a word merge template that coincides with each note template. Then you can create a document to print using this word merge option which pulls your note into a word doc. From there you need to edit spacing and copy and paste anything it failed to pull forward before you have a semi-professional note to print! Takes me at least an extra 20 minutes to do this! Ridiculous! Not to mention the price I was quoted and agreed to was half of what my average bill has been and they still, after 6 months have not been able to get billing set up with all my pay or sources! 
AdvancedMD is an all-inclusive software product that is able to manage all aspects of my clinic's needs.
It's not compatible Mac computers. This has been a challenge for us
# Tell the reader a bit about your organization and what makes it unique.
# Explain what made you look for new software (e.g. double entry of data and mistakes).
# What did you use before ADP AdvancedMD EHR Software (e.g. a similar system, spreadsheets)?
# What version of ADP AdvancedMD EHR Software do you use? When did you buy it?

It's been a love/hate relationship so far
I believe it has the capability to be an excellent product if it was implemented correctly.  
Lack of training during implementation - unable to use software to it's full capabilities because of lack of training -
