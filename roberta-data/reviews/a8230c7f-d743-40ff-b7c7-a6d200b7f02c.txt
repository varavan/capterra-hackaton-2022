I have had some great years with Plesk. Great price for the ease of use and functionality.
I really like that it is so easy to setup and that there is a great amount of information in the user forums and plesk help sections.
That it sometimes can be a bit hard to find the needed function in the administration user interface.
the incredible amount of basic functionality and the wide choice of extensions available
there are no negative aspects that I have encountered over the years
The UI is really good, It's really modern and simple.
It takes time to understand how the panel works.
I have been using Plesk for a long time, I always pick Plesk of other systems, even when it costs extra and I save in the long run with admin and server uptime.

As Plesk has grown over the years I have had to do less and less outside of the Plesk interface. I have had nothing I need to do server admin wise outside of Plesk for the last few years due to the feature-rich interface.
The user interface is easy to use. Plesk has all the different server options in easy to understand sections ready to be customised. 
When you want to do anything that Plesk can't do, can be hard to work out how to make the change or add the server tool you want.
We use Plesk server for many years so far. With each new release it became more and more powerful and stable. Currently we Plesk Obsidian we don't have any issues at all. We only periodically apply Plesk updates
We use Plesk Obsidian environment for web and email hosting. It's one of similar environments we use for years. The user interface is very intuitive and user friendly. There are many features and various types of downloadable content for web hosting. 
We still miss some features like email tracing. It's not available in GUI. We have to search mail logs manually via SSH session. 
With Plesk, I am no longer spending time typing some long commands in secure shell window because I can do almost everything with nice and functional Plesk interface.
- one control panel to rule them all - manage all websites from one place
- hundreds of plugins which extend the functionalities even greater
- regular automatic updates
- out of the box integration with cloud service providers like DigitalOcean, Vultr, AWS...
- full SSH root access remains available so if I don't like something I can customize it the old fashioned way
- amazingly good security and firewall integrated
- WordPress toolkit is a must-have if you manage multiple WordPress websites
- SSL integration with Let's Encrypt work flawlessly
- not so fast in loading speed compared to cPanel
- the dashboard can often be confusing with so many menus and options
- lack of support for Amazon Linux
- a little bit more expensive if you are looking for a shared web hosting with Plesk installed but in most cases, you will be using Plesk on your own VPS or server
Came to Plesk from a proprietary panel, found the community heartwarming and their support spot on.
It's constantly updated, feature rich, strong disaster recovery features
It could have better built in antispam features
I am very happy with Plesk as a web hosting management system. Its pricing is cheaper, features are great, now I do not have to worry about managing my secure server anymore.
Plesk is easy to set up, provides a feature-rich user interface for managing multiple websites. Supports Nginx, regular backup, and migration from popular web hosting management systems. The pricing for VPS with 10 domains starts at $11 per month which is an unbeatable price in the industry.
Plesk does not offer a single site license. 
I have been extremely happy with Plesk so far - I met some of the guys at WordCamp Nordic and they gave me an extended trial  - the whole system has blown me away and I can't wait for the new version to come out :)
For a start it works - doesn't crash all the time like other web hosting software. It works with ubuntu instead of CentOS which is huge for me. It integrates amazingly well with AWS, especially RDS and Aurora databases. Having Ngnix as standard is huge, it was a real issue with cPanel ... and the LetsEncrypt system works great. The NewRelix integration makes life easier.
Generally, it's pretty good - it can be a pain to install integrations with PHP (datadog, sqreen, etc), but this is just a learning curve.
A great experience! If you are uncomfortable with performing updates, changes or maintenance via a command line. Plesk allows you to perform most of these tasks through a user interface. It's an ideal CRM for web hosting.
Mostly everything! Plesk is great platform for managing a large number of website for clients. You can create and customise your own subscription plans, limiting or extending resources per client. The software is intuitive and you have available the essential features for managing website hosting.
One missing feature that would be very useful. The ability to upgrade your databases to newer versions of MySQL (5.5 > Current). Plesk already provides the capabilty to upgrade the PHP versions per website. Having the feature to upgrade the databases would be an extremely useful addition.
Overall, plesk is one of the best cPanel I have ever used so far. I faced challenges in the early days but its worth my effort. I can manage more than 5 websites easily without any lags. I will recommend non tech person to go through other cpanel videos and then use this cpanel app. They should add videos to make learning easy.
Its centralized way to manage everything like domains, email ids and multiple server data. I need to to move a bit from plesk to ad or remove any data from website, its easy. 

They also provide free SSL certificate which is best thing I can see in any cPanel. I can manage multiple websites of my clients without logging into them separately.
Sometimes, extension get failed or give error which make my website look weird. I also had difficulty to learn much of the thing eg. uploading and installing SEO extensions.

Cost get increased with more advance features which are not that much worth.
As a developer, Plesk is now my first choice to go with always  and I also recommend it to my clients as my experience with the community was excellent.

It does a great job in providing system insights in a really simple way.

It is a complete package with variety of features which makes it one of the best in the market. Some of the highlights are mentioned below:

- Backups are performed regularly. 

- Easy backup recoveries. 

- Simple and intuitive website management.

- Support for migrations from various known systems.

- Git, Nginx, Node etc comes out of the box and easy to setup.

- Due to the intuitive UI, the learning curve is mild so any new user can pick up really quickly and get started in no time
There's nothing majorly wrong with Plesk but of course, nothing is perfect so it has some issues with version controlling and CI/CD setups as it sometimes does not works as expected  with could potentially result in not fetching properly from the remote repository and ultimately failing CI/CD pipeline.

Apart from the above issue, it works smoothly
Poor service, very expensive, wouldn't recommend.
It's reasonably easy to use, but not as many options as the price commands.
Expensive for what it is. Customer support is horrific. You buy through a reseller and all support has to go through them, massively increasing time for support. Features are lacking and the price is astronomical for how basic it is.
I use Plesk with several clients and for my own services. It saves me a lot of time to manage different services.
Plesk has a nice, easy and very intuitive design. It has great features and each upgrade is better than the last. You can configure domains, emails, services, etc.

It is really easy to configure any part of your server and everything you need for your web application. It has integration with GIT, Docker, and much more... In addition you can see logs in real time, which is very useful when you have to detect any problem.
It could be a bit more economical, when you are a freelancer who has just started it is a bit expensive to pay month by month.
What can I say, Plesk is the go to server management software. It makes everything so easy. The UI is second to none and a single click can install applications,  encrypt websites and run audits.

I really like the login button on wordpress sites this makes updating wordpress a breeze.  The add ons are all priced really well and the whole package offers value for money.
Overall the software is very user friendly, but it would be nice to be able to declutter some of the workspace and limit the amount of options. to enable the lest tech savvy members of the team to use it well.
My customers see what I see so they're is no confusion or second guessing. 
Does what you would expect. It is easy and functional. 
Nothing. I haven't found a down side. It does what I want it to do. 
Really really good in the end.  I would make this choice again in the future.
For me who manage small hosting services in VPS is a fantastic choice: it is fast, fast, at an affordable and reliable price. He certainly loses in the competition with Cpanel but this is not necessarily a negative point. Finally UI and UX are really good. 
It doesn't integrate well with Cloudflare and that's really a shame, the mailbox management isn't perfect and for anything you have to pay. And A lot. The subscription to a classic antivirus often costs as much as 3 times the subscription. Often these services are nothing more than adaptations of open source code.  
I work with multiple websites runing WordPress and others CMSs as PrestaShop or Drupal. Plesk let me configure and optimice every website hosting as I preffer with múltiple options: PHP versions, SSL, Backups, etc. Also, I can work with sync and bulks options. Of course, I can update all the software using web interface o CLI with my own scripts.
- PHP versions handler and nginx options for every website.
- Full backup options: Incremental and integration with external sites
- Fail2ban and others security options.
- Extensions Catalog for more features
- Updates manager for Plesk and OS system packages.
- WordPress Tool Kit to work with this popular CMS most easy and with bulk options
- Online control panel with intuitive dashboards and CLI options for Shell also 
- Manage easy Let's Encrypt and others SSL certificates for every website
- Active 'User Voice' (plesk.uservoice.com)
- It isn't Open Source.
- It needs better options for configure cache systems.
- It needs more options for limit RAM/CPU and other resources by website/subscription/client.
- It needs easy options for upgrade default PHP version for run by system/Plesk.
- It needs Better support in spanish and others languages.
- There isn't a lot of extensions in catalog
- It needs more options for development stage easy with every website
- It needs license plans more flexibles
The UI is really good, It's really modern and simple
It takes time to understand how the panel works.
We use Plesk to manage our cloud servers. It provides a rich graphical user interface to replace command-line operations.
Very powerful and feature-rich. Can be set up for web hosts or for internal company use. Low cost. Allows administrators to automatically keep server software up to date.
Takes a little while to learn. Since it has so many features, it can be overwhelming at first for some.
