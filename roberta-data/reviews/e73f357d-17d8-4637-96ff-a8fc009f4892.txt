Direct booking and collect payment from the guest, so I do not need to install the payment gateway
Direct Booking Feature and Chanel Booking 
NO Smart Pricing  where we can set for minimum and maximum
Great team and service, making renting out apartments a joy especially to online platforms. Great help for getting performance tips. 
The synchronization of the channels connected to Your Rentals are handy, as everything is included. This is an up and a downside, as single adjustments and corrections are not available. 
Rate management should be made easier, especially if there are more than 1 accommodation to be administered. Cross comparison and combined management of several objects following similar patterns should be made available. E.g. seasonal management for all, rate adjustments with variations per object, (fixed/flexible), such as rate object 1 + x€ or x% for object 2 and all following settings.

rapides respostes del servei de suport
comode i facil funionament. tot molt clar
gran difusio
servei atencio al propietari exelent

el elevat cost final per el client degut a la alta comissio
- Confirm bookings instantly without having to respond to each request
- Connect to multiple OTA reservation system in only one place
- Possibility to copy listings from Airbnb or HomeAway
- Synchronisation of all calendars at once
- Secure and fast payment

- would be nice to include more complete price list form in basic rates (example different price for 1 night, and different for 2 nights etc) - in seasonal rates allow to put several dates for the same seasonal price
I don't really recommend Your.Rentals to people with only one property since it's easy to import calendars from one plateform to another. My experience maybe is not relevant with this software.
With several properties, it certainly is a valuable app.
Customer service is amazing!
There have been a lot of delay to publish my house on the different platforms. Thanksfully, i've published on AirBnB on my own seeing that is was not really fast. Also, i don't know why there are inquiries done about availability and prices. It takes time for the guests and they eventually didn't finalize the bookings.
Mon expérience avec your rental a été bonne et rentable, je conçois qu'il y ait quelques petits problèmes de temps en temps mais globalement tous va bien
La rapidité des réponses lors de réclamations et le fait de toujours avoir un interlocuteur 
rien de spécial si ce n'est que les frais chez Your Rental sont plus élevés que chez les autres cannaux
High performance, a lot of information, a very excellent program
So far, I have not found any negatives, but if I find any, I will inform the site
Rental of my holifay apartment in Gbay Mauritius. 
Very user friendly for home owners.
Convenient for people who do not have alot of time to spare to manage their properties online.
High commission rate.
Not enough publicity.
Easy to use and understand, complete for the management of a tourist services activity.
Perhaps the site is a bit slow and it seems to take a while to update changes especially the minimum number of nights on seasonal rates.
Overall experience is very good. The customer care and all the services from the co-worker are extraordinary and fast with all the answers with resolving all issues.
Uncomplicated / simple / straightforward.
Could have an easier system to push harder for special offers/last minute offers. Could have a system that advises open dates in the Apts/houses  and offers solutions to fill the open dates.
It would be useful that, maybe, one time in the year, Your rentals experts make monitoring of our business with goal to give us information where we make mistake in our business, what is good and what can be imorove
Some oportunitu what program offer are not clear to use for me.
Thè price copy from former year could be more simple
It is very good proces of sichnorizatiom with other platforms
Season price system can be imoroved.
When the program offers some news tools it would be good to give us some more information how to use that
This was my first year in the tourism industry. I realise now that Your.Rentals is the perfect product I was looking for. It perfectly fits my needs and priorities for my business.
 
A smart powerful software first to easily manage all listings, booking and payouts. 
I quickly saved time and resources maximising my presence and visibility on the worldwide vacations rental market.

Last but not least, the customer service: it's the real Your.Rentals' added value. Since the beginning Matteo has been a skilled product expert and advisor for support, issues, payouts, bookings and valuable suggestions. His day-by-day follow up helped me to easily improve my business in a reliable and transparent relationship. 

An authentic warm human touch in this cold tech-universe. Thanks man.
The ease of using it, the continuous assistance and the good price of the application
No one, is perfect in the way it presents itself
Very good and happy about it. The customer service are very helpful and personalized 
Multiple channels and easier control and monitoring 
Commission fees was a bit too high. Consider lower the commission and more flexibility on cancellation by property owners.
The customer support chat and follow up communication is excellent. We are made to feel a priority and this comes across with all team members. There is no 'help bot' causing frustration because it doesn't understand the question, you are through to a real person and that person does not leave you until they have helped you.
The ability to set seasonal rates easily, sync calendars, select channels and make edits to the property is  by far superior to other platforms. 
None, everything works really well. No issues.
Easy to contact
Channel manager for a number of sites which helps in advertising to a wider audience easily. 
Inaccurate descriptions of listings compared to the source material is derive it from. 
Your.rental is a great add on helping us sell better the apartment, as it probably doubles the turnover we would have gotten otherwise without it. 
The ease to expose the apartment to international online sales channels. Furthermore, also payments are not left out, which is what at the end counts. Great!
A great add on is the synchronization to the ical calendar. Your.rentals also helps in making your apartment more visible, giving you hints and tricks how better to sell it. 
Unfortunately there is no hold to influence presentations on the channels offered, as sometimes information is missfigured, even though Your.rentals got the correct information. Unfortunately the help desk was unable to solve that. 
It may be cumbersome in maintaining rates and seasonal offerings for more than one apartment. 
I don't know yet because it is the beginning.
It is easy to use it and covers many fields of information with few movements.
You have direct chat you solve fast and without cost your questions. 
At the beginning I could not understand how to listing the apartments. Make my listings.
I have been working with Your.Rentals for almost a year now and the most important feature to me is the possibility to use the channel manager, letting me have huge visibility in most of the important channels. I have saved a lot of time by just listing my property on one platform.
Nothing. It is a great software. Previously, I setup my listings directly in each sales channel, but setting up the first listing in Your.Rentals was faster, and I had to do it only in one place for all channels. It took just a few weeks to start receiving bookings and since then I'm seeing an increase in bookings week after week.
Your.Rentals helps me book my short term rental properties by having so many rental platforms for booking a vacation rental.
The software is very simple to navigate.
I really didn’t experience any problems navigating the website.
