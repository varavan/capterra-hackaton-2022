Never have to give our my personal cell number for work - love that!
Super easy to use and make phone calls. No gimmicks!
No easy way to mute yourself while on a call, and occasionally the call quality is slightly reduced (but only slightly...still quite good).
Easy, simple, intuitive and all a small business needs.
Not having your phone number available to receive faxes is why I chanved providers.
Was good overall and worked well for us in the beginning with helping give a professional feel to our phone system.
Like having a phone system that allowed calls to cell phone, voicemail options and a separate phone number for ease of use.
Became limited with the different voip options now available and was initially very reasonably priced but got more pricey and features didn’t seem to keep up with the new technologies.
Overall the system is easy to operate.  Good quality sound and a great value!
Easy to set up system.  Flexible, easy to use system and to forward calls and access voice mail.  Simple for clients to navigate system to contact individual persons with in the company.
The function of forwarding calls to individuals cell phones is not as clear as it could be to the end user as the caller ID only comes through as the company name or the recipients name since the call originated to the company, then the individual.  The system does not track the caller ID of the actual caller when the call is forwarded so you are answering blind.
This system linked directly to our cell phones and worked well while we used it. 
Felt like we outgrew this system and did not offer as many faetures as we would have wanted. 
My customers are still telling me how impressed they are with the new system. We've had it for just over a year now, and some of the aches and pains of the old system have faded in my mind. Even so, I can tell you it's leaps and bounds above the last system we had. It takes around 10% of the time I used to spend setting up old extensions, and causes almost none of the aggravation and worry I had with the old system.
It was very easy to set up, even though my company's phone system is pretty complicated. They have great tools that are easy to implement. For example, I change the forwarding for at least one of my extensions several times a day. This process is easy and everything works flawlessly, as does the simultaneous ringing of my cell phone when someone calls my extension. 

I had some trouble with one number I ported from another provider, and the help desk fixed it within a couple of hours. A few months later, I had problems porting a fax number from an online fax provider, and they fixed it immediately. (The fax feature provided by Grasshopper is excellent, too!) Their prices are very reasonable, and they have taken a great deal of worry off my plate. I am very glad I found this software!
I can't say I have had any problems with the software that wasn't taken care of immediately by the excellent tech support. I had a little trouble setting up the extensions and recordings, but I had never had anything but an old-fashioned phone system before. Considering my lack of experience, the virtual system was not hard to figure out, and it was well worth it!
We used this to call our customers and text our customers. If they could get the glitches and kinks worked out, it would be a much better program. It was good to used for days when you have multiple calls per hour as it is hands free and you can just call from your computer. However, it is not one hundred percent reliable. The experience I had makes me not want to use it again, unless they were to fix everything so it functions like it should. 
What I liked most about this software is that it provides a phone number and service that you can access using your laptop and headphones. It is easy to make calls from your computer, and you can send texts and check voice messages as well, and typed transcripts of those voice messages. It provides a professional looking phone system for your business and has a voicemail that is also seems professional  and can be set up to transfer to employee's Grasshopper phone numbers or to roll over to their cell phones. 
The problem with this software is that it is full of glitches. There were several times when Grasshopper sent the voice messages to the wrong phone numbers, the extensions got  changed or were wrong, or the app just stopped working all together. It seemed like every week or two, we had to waste time calling in to customer service to get them to fix the problems. Also, you could not send mass texts or multiple texts to more than one person without them seeing each other's phone numbers and all responses going to all people in the group text. So if we had a group session where we wanted to confirm, invite, or remind twenty people, we had to send each text individually through Grasshopper. This involved sending a text, copying it, going back a screen, typing in the next number, pasting the text, and then sending it to the next person. It was a time waster. 
Ultimately this system is very straightforward and easy to use.  For a small business, it provides the basic functions I need.  I needed a business line so I could keep my personal phone free of business and this served that purpose.  
One of my biggest frustrations is that it does not have a separate contacts function.  The phone app requires syncing with my personal phone contacts which is exactly what I did NOT want.  I wanted my business contacts completed separated from personal friends and family.  Even the desktop app does not allow for that.  
Very positive overall.
Grasshopper offers business telephone features that you will pay a lot more for with any other provider. You get a phone number, voicemail, unlimited calling, IVR, multiple extensions, and custom call management.
Lacks advanced call features you might find with other VOIP providers, and because it's a virtual phone service, you still have to use your mobile phone to answer calls. Also, the Android app is a bit buggy and doesn't always notify me when I've missed a call, so I have to open the app to check it.
If you just need basic phone features, it's fine.

If you business grows, you will soon find it too limiting. 

What disappoints me the most is, Grasshopper doesn't have a way to export or backup your text messages. The rep also claims they delete all of my text messages history immediately after I ported out my numbers. I only ported 2 of my 3 numbers out 5 days ago and i can no longer find the text message history. From the software design stand point, there is certainly no need to delete your customers text message history immediately after they ported their numbers. Also text messages take up negligible amount of storage space. It just doesn't make sense.
The price is affordable and it's easy to discover this company because their ads are everywhere on google. Among the competitor ads, Grasshopper offers good value and covers all the basic features.

But there are other better value system out there, but it will take a while for you to find them because they don't spend nearly as much advertising dollars.
Grasshopper is definitely a company that puts quite a bit of money on marketing. You find their google ads when you search for VOIP phone solution. I wish they had put the money into feature development instead. 

I recently switched to TalkRoute because Grasshopper is missing:
- Call recording
- Multi-level greeting menu


It allows us to have a toll-free number and individual extensions for our team members who are located throughout the country.  We have access to an easy-to-use app so that we never miss calls and never have to wait to be in front of the computer to return calls from the company phone #.
None that I can think of it.  This system is rather efficient and doing everything we need as a small business.
Overall, using grasshopper has helped my small business to maintain call center operations effectively. For the price, it is a good software to utilize. 
Grasshopper is very easy to use. They’ve made both web client and app available to make outgoing and receive incoming calls. 
The pricing for voip is higher then competitors but it’s easy to use as a combination with multiple numbers. 
Overall, I was highly pleased with the quick onboarding process. It took less than 30 minutes to have the app fully set up and my number activated. My business chose to go with Grasshopper primarily because it's a trusted and well-known name in VOIP. Grasshopper has enabled us to have a separate phone number for our business and adds a ton of convenience in that we are able to use it with their app on our smartphones.
I like that, compared to its competitors, Grasshopper offers a wider variety of useful features. Some of my favorite features are visual voicemail, conference calling, Wi-Fi calling, virtual fax, and business texting. All of those features and more are included in all of their plans at no additional cost.
There are only two things that I dislike about Grasshopper. The plan pricing is the first on my list. They offer three different plans; I have the cheapest one which costs $29 per month which includes the phone number plus three lines. Second, I dislike that in order to use the Wi-Fi calling feature, you must first disable the Wi-Fi calling feature if you already use it with your cellular plan.
Grasshopper truly helps small business owners with an easy to start service, great options and an overall great quality product. Some features including text based voicemail, encrypted faxes, text messaging, multiple phone services, and more. I would highly recommend this product as a personal user and have enjoyed using this product for over a year.
Grasshopper easily allows you to set up an 800 number for small business usage. It synchronizes with any phone very easily and usually takes about 5-10 minutes to begin working. Customers can call, text or fax information to the same number as opposed to having separate extensions which makes it very convenient not only to customers but the client as well. When a person calls you can choose to answer, send to voicemail, and/or check to see who is calling. If you are looking for separate extensions or have multiple employees across the state or nation then Grasshopper can provide service for multiple extensions and you can set up employees with Grasshopper as opposed to providing a business phone.
The downside about Grasshopper that I have found is that when a client calls it will automatically pop up as the 800 number you selected. This makes it easy in terms of identifying if someone is calling the business but at the cost of not identifying the customer unless you use the "to see who's calling" option before answering. This is a small issue however and as a personal business owner myself, I deal with multiple clients and customers across the state with frequent new customers whose numbers I wouldn't recognize.
overall weve been using grasshopper for 6mo and its boosted our sales
Our company decided to use this app for the days I am not working and the stores are closed. it gives our customers and potential customers to speak to our reps any day or time at our convenience. its great
the only con about this is we cant block any telemarketers from calling that number. other than that its a great addition to our store front
I just need a 1-800 line... That's what I get ! ...  ***you want 100 character min !?! Now this is weird **** Here are your extra character lol !
Some difficulties with the download of my record message.. Not a big issue ***you want 100 character min !?! Now this is weird **** Here are your extra character lol !
Overall this product offers great and easy call routing to all users within our company. Not only has it saved on extremely high in-office phone costs it allows users to manage their calls from their cells/computers.  The customer service is also fantastic. I once made mistake when adding and removing an employee, after calling in not only did they resolve the issue but they also fixed it without me having to do it myself. That shows me a high level of training that I respect. Teaching someone what to do, but also acknowledging there time is a high PRO in my books for this modern age.
The only cons were getting my office line released from our previous carrier. This took much longer than expected. Also, some of the online instructions were a bit vague. BUT if you called in they helped out great over the phone.
Love being able to test phone numbers and seeing the activity it is  having on their account.
I love that I'm able to submit many phone numbers into the tool. I'm able to give credit and issues refund really easily. 
Sometimes I feel I have to submit many manual entries, it would be better to be more automatic on certain features.
Grasshopper was great for call forwarding, creating lines for team members and transcribing messages. I liked that it would transcribe and email messages to whoever we selected.
Grasshopper became a costly option as it was not used too terribly much but still required a monthly fee plus per minute charges.
You can schedule posts for many weeks in advance all at once. Cuts down on constant time on social media
It can be sort of confusing if you don't understand everything to begin with.
