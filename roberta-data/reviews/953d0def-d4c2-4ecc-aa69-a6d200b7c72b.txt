a good way for everyone to practice for tests.
good connection with costumers
it is very easy to add a new costumer.
we use the update option very often.
ccccccccccccccccccccccc
it is not possible for a customer to work the app with their computer. only smartphones and tablets.
It is a tool that has made us get and stay connected. It highly reliable and highly functional. 
Connecteam is currently being used across the whole institution as one of our most preferred communication platform. With the tool we feel connected since there is real time communication across department. The software is also easy to use and less expensive.
Hardly can i mention  a dislike if the software . It worth every penny and i love it.
Communication, scheduling, vehicle inspection's : All of this has been made easier by using connecteam. 
I have a transport company employing about 100 drivers. We use connecteam for scheduling, communications, task management. 
There are some glitches when texting from the IOS version of the app, I've provided this feedback to the connecteam team and they are improving. 
Very easy to use, easy instructions. We learned how to use this software in 1 day! Great product and highly recommend it to everyone.
I like this software most for connecting people and very easy to use effective and can also very smooth access in mobile also
I think it is nice software overall but the only con is that we cannot connect with more than 20 people 
Allowing each user to access the app and log their times and request vacations, helps our company to be more organize and offer more options to our employees. Very reliable. 
Very easy to use. The transition was very easy using the import tools. Great customer service, very needed when you are implementing a software to manage time tracking, payroll, and adding 50+ users. 
I wish there could be more options regarding permissions for individuals instead of groups. 
Solution for scheduling, time and attendance, and reporting is crucial. It's a win-win situation for everyone involved. It's also a terrific way to interact with employees, build a sense of community, and provide a place to voice their opinions. We've just scratched the surface of what's possible with so many tools at our disposal.
Most frequently, the Terminal app comes up short. Using the app is not an option for everyone. We experience problems with the kiosk from time to time, and it's tough to replicate them to seek help. Most issues are likely a combination of tablets and terminal failures. 
I am having a satisfactory experience, even comparing it with other software that performs the same functions. The Connecteam app has helped me to significantly increase my performance as a consultant, this has the same impact on my teammates as monitoring to the point of achieving objectives that in principle seemed unattainable.
The app is only available on mobile and can be very limiting who is not on admin access.
Only upload the features you want. Not laden through bloatware or functions we can in no way us. Extremely intuitive. Once create an account, do the five minute walkthrough and also you experience assured sufficient to control yoir company. - Their free alternative is absolutely very beneficial and consists of 80% of the functions. - FLAT-FEE pricing! Once you make a decision to upgrade (we chose $29 plan) No 'per-user' fee like simply each different solution. One flat-charge and might upload as much as two hundred customers and not using a hidden fees. - 24/7 stay aid; even for the unfastened account! When we first were given started, we had a pair hiccups, and at 1:30am, their stay aid spent over an hour supporting us get the entirety running perfectly (thank you once more Noam). - Supports remote places personnel in different international locations natively. E.g. we've personnel in Philippines, and the established the app and validated their telecellsmartphone numbers thru textual content on their Philippines telecellsmartphone and not using a issue. Can textual content-message filipino labored via app, even on unfastened mode. Messaging/chat alternatives are manner higher than different messaging apps. Like 'voice' chat, and the capacity to combine different formats. Supports wealthy textual content. Take FB messenger, Sling, and viber and integrate all of the proper functions, and that is what you have. GPS monitoring of all faraway personnel.
At the time of scripting this review, all admin functions need to be performed, and now noapp (though they are saying they're running on that). - Could use extra hierarchy, apart from simply basic. Would be great to peer customizable permissions for Administrators (might also I failed to see). App best helps Android and iPhone. No computing device app for Windows or Mac available.
Saving many staff hours of work, ensuring better quality installs. Building personal relationships with staff even if they cannot be at the office. Feeling like the team we always knew we could be - just gives me goosebumps! 
So easy to use and set up. Normally it would rely on me to do the whole set up roll out, where now I can have each department work on their own setup. 

The staff & support - they are just so amazing, friendly and helpful. I think they might be aliens as they NEVER sleep. I tend t work late and they are always there to help. Would love it if I can get my support department to run that optimally. Will have 100% satisfied customers! 
They are already working on the project / tasks which will just assist us with projects that takes up to a month at a time. Seems like everything I wanted they have already had discussions internally and working on it. They seem to ever improve on an already perfect product! 
This has been a game-changer for us.  I have been looking for a program that would allow us to track all employee activities..  Connecteam has helped us improve our training, workflow, and employee communication.  It is easy to use, and our employees love being able to improve their performance day by day.
I wish it had the abilty to add different fields in the forms section
The GPS location is great, it allows a simple and effective way to know where the different is, a good distribution of time is also noted ... in sum yes connecteam is important in my various actions.
only defect of gain, but apart that it goes
A melhor plataforma desse tipo em escalabilidade! Este é o único aplicativo que encontrei que me permite personalizar quase tudo... sensacional
Connecteam as vezes fica muito pesado e demora abrir

123FormBuilder is perfect for creating many different types of forms from questionnaires to surveys and more! I’ve never had an issue finding what I needed because they have an endless amount of options to design and brand whatever type of form your business needs! However, there is a learning curve (due to the many different options) so it can be overwhelming, and the outdated look doesn’t help. Also, the price point is a bit high at over $20 a month but if you can afford to pay this then it will definitely have you covered on anything and everything you’ll ever need to create endless beautiful and professional forms

Pros
Customizability, particularly with r
Customizability, particularly with regard to matching website design. This helped things look slick, rather than out of place. The site was seamless with these form additions.
One-off payment integration requires a higher subscription
It has been amazing. Nathanel went above and beyond in so many different ways to help me out today. He was so knowledgable and understanding and wanted to make sure he was able to help me to the best of my ability. Give him a raise, and don't let him leave. I wish all customer services reps were as amazing as he was!
I like that I can have a time stamp to track where our employees are. 
It would be nice to have a way to track each task they are doing, that isn't in the job scheduling. It would be nice to track the time spent on the task as well. Also, having invoicing and estimates, and more templates geared to specific industries, like a handyman. 
Overall we are extremely happy with Connecteam and the fantastic support we received since implementation. The customer service team are friendly and always ready to help.
Ease of use, price & solid support network.
Overall performance is very good, of course there are many areas which can be improved however this is more fine tuning of the product rather than wholesale changes.
We like the GPS location reporting of where our team members are clocking in from.  Being in the construction field, our job-sites change on a daily basis.     Great value for the savings we received from either accidental or intentional time punches.
For our needs, there are no complaints.  The reporting provided useful information, the edits were easy and the overall experience was seamless.
AMAZING! Cant' complain whatsoever.
We love connect team for its awesome features with keeping track of hours. As well as staying on top of our employees with their day to day tasks. 
I think the software is amazing and has lots of little neat things. The only con I can think of would be setting things up is a little hard, but when you have the help of Noam there can't be any cons. 
At first, everyone we worked with was professional and kind, walking us through several demonstrations until we found the best pricing package for our needs. Automating and embedding daily routines began as an effort to keep track of time.
Mastering the differences between a synchronized and an unsynchronized time system and the advantages of each was a long process, but once we got the hang of things, everything went well.
