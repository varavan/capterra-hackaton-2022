I said game changer and mean it. We are a startup in the payroll industry. Learning and organizing all the processes was overwhelming. We tried writing out processes in word and saving to our shared drive. Not good. With process plan, we were quickly able to organize our most important processes, actually learn the processes better by building them out in process plan, and are now confident we can bring on new hires and not worry about trianing them on everything. We highly recommend Process Plan. 
We have so many different processes it was becoming hard to keep track as a startup. Being able to organize everything has been incredible. 
The built in videos are great, just need some more. That said, personal support is great. I just sometimes would like to watch a video to learn something quickly. There’s so much functionality, it takes time to learn. 
Was able to map out processes for project based activities easier than a checklist. It also triggers events, notifications, etc to individuals and project teams.
The ability to design your own processes , activities, and desired outcomes and to be able to map it out using their visualization features. You can create and run multiple ones for different projects or different groups/departments which is nice, and concurrently.
Mapping the software is easier on a tablet than a PC, and since I primarily work on PC, it was less effective for my uses. Still, the power of initiating tasks was great when first developed, it just made upkeep or creating new ones a challenge w/ PC. 
It truly is an amazing program. I have been looking for 4 years to find something like this and after probably 5-6 trial and errors of other similar, but definitely not as brilliant, programs we found ProcessPlan and we will never look back. There is nothing on the market quite like this and we will be part of ProcessPlan for a very long time! The customer service is outstanding and right there if I need it. Updates and tutorial videos allow me to learn to do new things I didn’t even know I could and then creates a whole new and exciting aspect of it. You change your template and all the process which haven’t gone past that point automatically updates saving me time and effort to go through every open process to update same. 
The adaptability of it is amazing! Doesn’t matter what part of the organisation you are dealing with, you are able to change and adapt ProcessPlan to what you need.
I literally have nothing to say here.....
After some configuration it did it job perfectly - helped to coordinate a large distributed team in multiple offices to work on recurring non-linear processes. The  best example here being hiring and employee on-boarding. 
The UX is definitely an area ProcessPlan team can improve. Also in the last 1.5 years there where updates that broke the currently used processes - from mixing up fields, to dropping  the currently ongoing processes. Also I'm not sure if the introduced improvements always created a coherent UX and UI or where just thrown in. Tried to improve some of the process maps we had - but this turned out to be non-trivial, again the UX - but on the administrative side, might be a challange even for power users. 
I started using ProcessPlan several months ago when I was about to go on maternity leave. It was very helpful and made delegating my tasks much easier. 
How helpful it is especially when an employee is off, no longer with the company, etc and another employee needs to take over their duties. It also creates accountability. 
Depending on how the tasks are set up, they can be very repetitive and unnecessary. This can most likely be resolved with tweaking of the processes. 
So far, works at par with our expectation.
Process plan is a Nice app. It helps us with our daily tasks
The program is a bit complex and hard to manage
Overall I am very impressed.  Especially by the team's ability to react to support and feature requests.
ProcessPlan is simple and intuitive to use.  It makes it possible to allow tech savvy business users to build and maintain worfklows.  IT only need get involved in advanced edge cases.
ProcessPlan has very little data forms capability, which is an area that can be improved.  
I see great potential for PP to be a sales enablement tool.  
You really need help to understand what the tool can do.  You are almost forced to get consultant time to help with CRM integration.  We were hoping for a turnkey solution.
ProcessPlan is a very customizable platform for managing all kinds of tasks, processes, and documenting how your organization functions. Particularly, if you have repeatable processes, this is the perfect way to set them up. You can run the process with the new information and then everyone on the process is notified when they need to be. The people you notify do not even have to be ProcessPlan users. This makes it great for organizations both large and small.
You can map out and execute whatever you want, literally bring your processes to life.
Because ProcessPlan is so customizable, it can take a little bit to get comfortable using the platform. But, once you have the hang of it, it's easier.
Automatically assigns tasks to the correct person. Goes through each step so nothing is missed.

A little bit slow to update when clicking ok and save etc
The responsiveness and knowledge of their support has been great!  They helped us to create some pretty advanced process flows and were extremely helpful.
The solution is highly configurable and with Zapier you can automate a lot of the business processes and keep your team involved.
I haven't found anything yet that I would consider a con with this project.
The ease of creating and modifying processes allows everyone in the organization to actively participate in workflow design as opposed to delegating the task of assigning responsibility to one person in inside the company.  It creates a collaborative work environment during the design stage of process development.
The initial set up requires very detailed thought.  If you get the set up wrong, it cascades through the project.  However, this is true of all process development work - 90% of the work is done upfront, then the rest is easy.
I used this to process a couple requisition requests and even though this part of the process was new to me, it was simply to use.
It was easy to use. I wasn't familiar with it but it didn't take long to understand.
I have no complaints with this software.
Software is very user friendly.  I like that I can see past work orders.
Software defaults users phone number in contact field which may change or ticket may not be for that individual.
Hiring new employee.  I utilized Porcess Plan because our company requires it.
Quick and to the point, but still more steps than before the software was used.
I prefer the old less technical process on paper, etc.
I really like the software. From my research, it was the most affordable software which offered a graphical interface for process design. The next price-point up from there was pretty far-off from ProcessPlan. Additionally, I've found it more functional than using a pure app-integration service.
Process design in the graphical interface. I seem to think "visually" and I always prefer seeing processes laid out in the form of a flow diagram. Process Plan's strongest feature is that it brings a flow chart to life automatically. 
Running of processes within the organisation can get tricky. Some team members complained of not knowing what to do in the graphical interface. Just took some getting used to.
Great way to collaborate and work with my client
This is a great app for work collaboration especially if we work as a freelancer 
It's not giving notifications in my mobile 
Process Plan is legit ideal for our broking business. But, there is lots of room for improvement and will be an amazing software once developed more.
The process flow of the tasks (when working correctly) and the map. Love that when you select a line, it highlights blue so you can keep track of where it flows too.
Lots of bugs. When a task is meant to move forward, the whole process closes into complete mode. Very frustrating. 
The audit side of the software is very basic and not great.
Search options and saving certain criteria is not the best.

An answer to your process capture and process knowledge transfer wishes.  If you have knowledge workers you need this product.
This app is for anyone who is not a process control plan nerd.  It lets you document and capture your critical processes and then begin to automate them in an easy to adopt learning curve.  Their client services group will jumpstart your project with their very powerful facilitated sessions.   Well worth the investment of your time and money
The visual flowchart is only part of the design stage, not the day-to-day process flow as a view of the process.  I'd love to open a flowchart, jump to a step and drill down into actions, assets etc from that starting place.
