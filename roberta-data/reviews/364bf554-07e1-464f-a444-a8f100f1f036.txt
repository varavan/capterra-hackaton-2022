I love the fact that my clients can now book their own appointments right online from the listing of my available options right on a unique website just for me. They get an email notification (as do I) and they get text reminders. The text blasts are phenomenal and the drip campaigns work wonderful! I have already referred this to colleagues who have gotten it up and running. The customer service has been great. The representatives I have spoken to (INCLUDING THE CEO) have addressed my questions and helped get things coordinated and synced with my google calendar. That was the biggest selling point for me, total integration with my calendar which blends my business appointments and family appointments all in one place.
I am hoping for a better mobile interface for the future. That is the only con I have. Otherwise, would be a 5-star rating.
Text message, appointment reminders, scheduling
Easy to use. User firendly. Clients love to receive birthday massages
I like everything about program. I can't say anything bad about programm
Makes my job easier, saves me time and money having to pay someone to do the texting for us.
There is always room for improvement. Having to some thing manually.
is very accessible and easy for us customers to understand.

I loved the ease of use it has, its interface and others, I had a better contact with the companies or any type of service, it is very good compared to others and generates me a lot of confidence for now.
for the moment I don't notice any disadvantage, but I hope they will continue with this way of working.
I like, for the customer service they provide, another of the things I like is a flat rate, an easy and friendly system to use
I like that it does the work for me, the image and the presentation of your brand makes them position you as the best, so textellent reminds my clients of any related matter
that we still cannot guarantee appointments, with the collection of banking information, to avoid cancellations
See above. More campaigns and all year availability with clients
Ease of use for text, calendar, charts and increased communication with clients.
Limitation on users in calendar. I understand that only 5 users are allowed on calendar.
I love Textellent. It saves me a LOT of time, allows me to quickly contact my leads, clients, co-workers and make sales faster. 
I love the automation it takes time away from all the tedious Copy, Pase,  Sent text. It is also a very well set up platform, I can look for any lead follow up easy and they can contact me in both calling and Texting ways. 
I wish more companies would realize the importance of having this product so that it would merge easily to CRM's and other Softwares out there. 
So far its been great!
We like that is application sends out Birthday notifications to our clients. There are so many futures in this  application that I have not utilized yet. In reality the best part of this app is the tech support I always get from Courtney Willis. She is amazing, friendly, knowledgeable and best of all she knows 3 languages! Courtney has so much patients to explain to me how to download my flyers and even helps me composing my Text Blast I send to all of our clients. Love the her expertise and always is a pleasure to speak to someone so nice. Kudos to her Great customer service! 
The only thing i don't like is, i wan to send English and Spanish flyers and i want to send them with a space in between with a message. Sends both of them together
I was sold once I saw the potential to reach clients and have them respond to us.  Most clients love to hear from us and love the messages.
It is easy to use and prepare texts blasts.  We've been doing 2 a month at least for holidays and client updates.  This is in addition to the standard texts sent for birthdays that are done automatically.
That clients call the text number thinking it's our office, but it's not really the software!
Text automatically and scheduling great product
Nothing everything is great and wonderful 
Textellent is a simple and quick way to get in touch with other companies, it can be used by small and large companies, to schedule contacts, send information and streamline business.
I didn't see anything disadvantageous in Textellent.
I have been very pleased with not only their service but also their easy set u and support. I never had issues with loading my contacts and getting the messages out on time. 
nothing at this time, so far our experience has been fantastic  
I love this texting program. It definitely helps me with my  tax business.
It helps me streamline my communication with my clients
There are some hiccups at times, but I can always reach out to supports for assistance.
Increased our ability to get messaged to customer quickly.  Customers responded well to the texts and we were able to have customer dialogue that we would not had had without it.
Easy to use, great options for custom message, immediate customer service response.  Quality product that resulted in increased customer revenue.
Expense was greater than what I felt comfortable with as my budget is tight.

Great business decision with positive impact; reliable and fast customer support.
Mass texting makes communication very fast and easy with clients; Managing appointments very easy.
No negative impact so far-experience has been good
EXCELLENT SERVICES
IT IS EASY TO USE. IF I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE I ALWAYS CALL FOR HELP
I DON'T REALLY KNOW. EVERYBODY IS VERY HELPFUL TO ME.
My clients really appreciate receiving the text messages.  I am able to communicate with them via Textellent when phones/internet are out due to natural disasters.
Textellent is user friendly, with great customer support.
There are no features of this software that I dislike.
Implementation of the product was quick and seemless; Textellent provides instructions on how to export the client list from my tax software into their platform.   MY CLIENTS LOVE IT -- regardless of client age, everyone has a cell phone.  Clients who previously did not engage with us via email engage with us via text.  This saves us time and money.  We hired one less seasonal person last tax season by using Textellent.
Customers/clients want to engage with their service providers via texting.  This product allows us to easily integrate our existing clients into a platform which allows for texting on issues from appointment setting through missing information follow-up.  And its highly automated, saving time and money.
I wish I had started with it sooner, th prudct pays for itself.
The platform is user friendly and support is always helpful.
I like the fact that once my client list is uploaded,  birthday text goes out. It's easy to send out text blast. I create it one time and it goes out to everyone.  I don't have to keep track of my clients being updated on events or important info to keep them informed. 
Don't like the fact that there is a charge for send out personalized text blast.
