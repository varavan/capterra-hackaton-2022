There have been some challenges with our users that do not have the appropriate version of the software to integrate into their Microsoft product (Excel). Potentially could solve with a more intuitive FAQ section on their website.

You need Excel to use it (most people have it) but this inherently limits its potential in terms of graphic capability
The ease of use and the cost are my two favorite attributes.
The functionality is not on the same level as Minitab but it provides the essential things you need.  I've also experienced some freezing up of the software.

SigmaXL is a great product that allows us to measure, analyze, improve and control our services, processes and production processes. As an add-on to the already familiar Microsoft excel, I love SigmaXL and it's ideal for use in Lean Six Sigma training or a college statistics course.

Since it is an Excel Add-In is very intuitive. No need to use scripts like Python or R.  Affordable.
As a matter of fact,  being a an Add-In makes it extremeley easy to use it. Maybe it needs more elegant plotting capabilies.

SigmaXL is used exclusively for all Performance Improvement and Six Sigma activities
I have been using SigmaXL (and using it for all Black Belt and Green Belt classes) since 2003.  It supports all of my needs and does not require the extensive training that MiniTab does.  Also, it's a great value, much less expensive than MiniTab.  Every single person I buy SigmaXL for loves it.
Nothing.  SigmaXL has everything I need, including exceptional customer support
I like the ability to change parameters on the same data set and re-run to get accurate result.
Having to go back to activate SigmaXL in the middle of analysis if I forgot to activate before starting work on spreadsheet,
As a teacher and practitioner of Six Sigma, I find SigmaXL a great option for those not looking to invest significant $'s into traditional statistical software.  It also removes possible barriers that exist with IT or management buy-in on the purchase/use of statistical software.
