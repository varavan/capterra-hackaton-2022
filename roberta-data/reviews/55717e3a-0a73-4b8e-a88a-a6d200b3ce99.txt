Great event management software with other useful features like email marketing campaigns, payments, membership and mobile apps. 
EventBank allows us to build great-looking event pages in few minutes. Platform is easy to use and offers everything that modern event organizers need in 21st century. Great thing is that the platform is in several languages, including Korean and we have an option to publish events in multiple languages and send out invitations and other email campaigns.  EventBank apps are also useful and they come with the software for free! Their customer service is great can speak both English and Korean and we get a reply to every query super-fast. 
Members can edit there details directly instead of sending it to  us, online registration is also being done. Membership has increased.
Our finance department wants a specific tax invoice, which is not available  in the platform. It would be good  if that is  looked into.
The GlueUp team offers a customizable solution for our organization to help us manage our membership database. While this is our main use of the product, we also have access to Event Management and Email marketing features which help us further connect with our audience.
There's a little bit of a learning curve on the back end if you haven't used CRMs before- but their team is eager and willing to help train you and get you on track.
1. It is very easy to use
2. The feature to send out campaigns is awesome
3. Language options in Mandarin, English and Spanish
4. Available on Mobile Phone (Apps)
5. Checking In Attendees during events are super convenient, scanning QR codes, search by names, etc.
Sometimes the detailed information of the checking in status isn't synchronize. So it creates confusion on how many people have actually checked-in or not.
Event management, CRM, email marketing, engagement solution, event website builder, mobile check-in, most popular online payments, integration with WeChat. 
So far so good. Overall experience is great. Some event website and email marketing templates can be improved. 
It was good in general I liked the way it was organized and the effectiveness of it.
the software was very efficient and easy to use although there are some features that can be improved over time.

I wish they could include some features to facilitate the integration processes 
We recently launched our organization and didn't have a dedicated website, resources, or team in place as the launch event was quickly approaching. EventBank was able to help us in all of these areas with their all-in-one platform. 

I like the fact that I can easily sort by who actually checked into the event and follow-up accordingly once the event is over. In addition, the event pages look great which really helps for an organization like ours that doesn't have a website yet. This platform has been critical for us in building our community, I can't imagine how we would have been able to track and manage the necessary information without EventBank.

Lastly, the customer support has been amazing! I have been extremely comfortable using this software knowing that the support/CS team is there every step of the way. 
Yet to encounter anything negative from the platform
It has all functions we need, event registration, EDM, and membership management. Easy to use, safe as a bank. We would like to recommend Eventbank to other platform/corporations because it integrate all the functions, you don't need to use different systems instead. We hope eventbank could be improved as well, the bug still exists at this stage, but we have confidence that eventbank will be the best system for us. 
Beautiful design, easy to publish an event, many options for EDM, can manage different types of members easily.
The bugs sometime occurred in the evening. We cannot open the system or the clients cannot register an event occasionally.
When membership, consumer relationship management, events, advertising, and financial control are all integrated, it becomes possible to use this as the sole medium to run the organization's activities. Having the option to accept payments online is a massive boon for us.
Some features might be streamlined for easier access. Adding the ability to personalize things like bills and automated emails would be incredible. The system has some minor delays at times; it might be quicker. 
The Social Community is awesome! Works really well to engage the installer together
Some of the processes were a little complicated, but the support staff were great at finding a work around

glue up was the most professional looking and complete software I have found.
I really liked the practicality of the software and the way it makes your life easier when holding events, it fulfills its purpose and offers complete and sophisticated features
there is nothing bad to say, just the storage capacity of the software
Easy-to-use, great customer support, streamlined services. Using Eventbank has saved me so much time registering users and checking them in at events. It's also allowed me to easily gather data and compare attendees across events. 
Accessibility for visually-impaired users is lacking (but is in the works), and it sometimes glitches on when the app is used on the iPad.
An easy to use, cloud based software with an open and accessible development and technical team, Eventbank has solved our biggest internal problem in adminstration - by providing us with an easy to access CRM. Adding contacts is easy; plus once members have registered for their accounts they can manage them themselves, update all the information necessary and sign up to committees without having to constantly get in touch with our busy Executive Team. Eventbank will prove to free up some time for our staff on tasks that previously took twice as long to do. 
Eventbank has a great, easy to use interface which allows for companies to enter in their own fields in the database/CRM section. Contacts are easibly seperable from companies in the CRM, as well as containing a seperate (but linked to the CRM) member database (something very important for us).  For our company Eventbank is definitely a major upgrade in comparison to our old CRM. Eventbank has extremely useful guidance videos that help when beginning to learn and get accustomed to the software. The Eventbank team is also open to feedback and seeing how they can improve their features for future customers needs.
The largest drawback for us is the lack of customisability in relation to some features we required (i.e. in regards to invoicing), however as the software is continuously being updated we hope that in the future we will be able to use those features in the future. 
Having a smart data and easier facility to manage the event registration and campaign  
We so far really appreciate Its feature for easy registration flow. Thus, we can manage better our event
Interface of membership. It would be better if the platform could facilitate easier way to preview the corporate members too. 
The best tool for event management.
Very convenient tool to maintain and acquire members. That's crucial for our business so this has been a great help.
There are minor issues with some of the registration functions.
Took a while to get used to all the controls and features. Once familiar, is rather intuitive. Customer support has been very helpful throughout. 
EventBank has most of all the features that you'd need, and even the features you never thought you'd need. A good all in one CRM, event and comms platform. 
Automated emails or notices being sent to our members without our control / ability to customise or prevent. Eg. When importing new members to company memberships. We need to be able to control this urgently.
Great experience and great value for money product.
Quite easy to create an event just in a few minutes.
Payment options are localised based in a country.
Great for assigning navigation languages, etc.
Great event management system.
Ease of use and integration.
Responsive customer service.
Editing and creating anything on a platform is quite slow.
Member to member engagement features can be improved.
There's registration limitations.
Yale Center Beijing hosted hundreds of events and managed tens and thousands of contacts using this platform. Better than Eventbrite for China because of its China-friendly functionalities. Nice interface and easy to use.
Incredibly easy to use, both for our admin who created the event online but also for our staff at the check-in desk on the day of the event. Seamless and customizable excel sheets for attendees information makes CRM simple and enjoyable. Excellent user support and customer service- EventBank team members supported throughout the process of setting up the event, polite and helpful.  Can't wait to use it again! 
Nothing negative to say! This was our free trial, looking forward to using the software again in future events.
