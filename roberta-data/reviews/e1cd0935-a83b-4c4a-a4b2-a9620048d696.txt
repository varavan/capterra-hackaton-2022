Software is very easy to use.  Reports can be ran quickly.  Feedback from all my employees has been positive.
Support is lacking a little, but when you do connect with them they solve the issue.
We love the ability to record and listen back to calls that come in to our customer experience agents.
The interface could use some updating as it's a bit outdated feeling.
I really like the ease of use for 800Respone 
Customer service is a little thought to get a hold of, but Iâ€™ve never really had any major issues. 
When I first looked at 800response, I was interested in the Unique Callers for our dealership. Right away I was able to find this, and its easy to understand, and export the data.
No complaints, I have always been able to do everything intended. It would be nice to be able to automate reports and have them directly sent out to my email
Our Account Manager Mariann is really great, she replies to my emails very quickly and is always ready to help.  
Missed calls featured along with the callers detailed on address and income.  Call forwarding, is very easy, having a catchy business phone number  866-6AMAZIN.

Scheduled reporting 

There isn't any cons yet that I have noticed 
Our sourcing has never been more accurate and correct - this is making marketing near perfect.
This software helps a ton with marketing & correctly getting the sources placed per call.
Wish we could integrate this software with Salesforce (improveit 360) - our CRM.
If your looking for great vanity numbers look no more. 
Easy to use.  Might take a few hours to get a response from customer service. 
800 Response has been an invaluable resource over the last 10+ years. The ability to listen to our clients' calls and how our agents communicate with them has been essential to our success. Having all of our inbound toll free calls in a single easy to use data base, simplifies decisions like how we spend our advertising dollars and consistently improve practices for direct communication with customers.   
There is nothing I would consider a negative--delivers all we expect.
We use this for subjects to call into our office who are interested in clinical trials and it has been working great for us this far.
It's easy to use and have not had any issues.
We like the service as the software is easy to use.  
Easy to use and a valuable asset to the business
We did not have any issues utilizing the software
Easy to use, multiple applications & features.
Nothing, I enjoy the product. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
800response provides outstanding service and insight that helps connect us with our customers. 
800response offers tremendous flexibility in call handling and routing capability, but more than that, they provide insights into our leads. They have the ability to append demographic data to our inbound callers, which allows us to improve our targeting efforts. And the customer service is excellent. Our account manager is in contact with us constantly, not only addressing issues, but providing insightful guidance and recommendations. 
There are some attractive optional features, but the minimum pricing is not very cost efficient for us given the number of calls we receive. 
Very clear, and simple to show the data that I was using
I wasn't able to create graphs out of this
For 17 years, our relationship with 800 Response has been excellent.
Our admissions team uses the software daily & depends on it's reliability.  Our questions a re always answered in a timely fashion, in a professional manner.
I am not the end user. I would have to survey our admissions counselors to determine if they have any issues.
The ease of use and the ability to listen to recorded phoen  calls
I have nothing bad to say about this software 
Everything has been great!  The software always works and the staff members are always helpful.
The simplicity of use.  It is never down and is very simple to use.  It is very cautious about changes and is sure to make sure that you know what you are doing.
I could see it becoming obsolete someday with how newer corporate phone systems work.
I'd say our overall experience with 1800 responses is more than we could have asked for. Maryann has gone above and beyond to take care of us and is always willing to answer any questions we have or give demo's on how to use 1800 response. 
Having access to pull calls and listen to them. Sediment report is also a great factor.
We have nothing we like least. If I had to say something, the representatives tend to be a bit aggressive with follow-ups.
Routing of our clients' calls to our offices through a round robin system depending on the zip code. This allows our clients to be properly served depending on their needs.
This software is very easy to use. Under our considerations, reports are most impactful, they are very good and customizables. Integration with our business was easy.
Integration with our business was not difficult. Product is very easy to use.
Plenty of designed reports for you to use, all of which can be easily modified for specific dates, and exported to excel
No complaints, I have been able to do everything that I intended to so far
We have been with 800response for years and years - and are very satisfied.
helps train, capture all leads and ensures we do not miss any opportunity, keep the data accurate.
I do not have anything I dislike at this time.
