Easy to use and manage. Made the managing of safety in my store a lot easier 
Nothing I don’t like about donesafe. Overall it is a great tool
Across our clients who use Donesafe we have seen huge improvements in safety culture, increases in reporting and resolving hazards and reductions in workplace injuries.    Our clients range from sole traders to large companies across a range of industries and Donesafe has features and pricing that can be tailored to suit every one of them. 
As a Safety Specialist, Partnering with Donesafe has allowed us to give our clients access to a flexible safety management system which gives them real time data and allows them to take control of safety within their businesses. 
It is so easy for front line staff to use, and is accessible from any internet enabled device  
The initial setup can be be a bit daunting  as the software is so flexible. However implementation assistance is available through partners like Excite Safety.  We can assist businesses customise the software to meet their exact requirements
The software allows me to monitor all factors of the business that relate to the safety of the customers, employees and food. It allows me to add comments to all records and requires a digital-signature before it can be marked as approved.
The system at this stage has no faults from me, and I have not been advised of any issues with this software.
I have come to know that writing hazards on this software is so much easier to use than using a paper filing system.
The ease of use and how intuitive the software is when completing checklists and writing hazards in the workplace.
The training system is a bit complicated to use
Bon travail

Il n'y a vraiment pas d'inconvénient a mon avis.

this application has helped solve many hazardous situations in the workplace
the ability to report hazards and for your workplace
more features for users not just for admins
Pas mal
Prix abordable, intuitif et convivial, l'assistance répond toujours 
j'attends seulement la nouvelle mise à jour, après tout est parfait pour moi
I did not want to conform and change my internal processes because software forced me too. This is the only platform I found that can easily adapt to the way I want to work.
- Easy to use
- Can be configured and changed as business and legislation changes
none                                                                                                                                                                                 
Just a really easy step by step process
Clear and easy to read text format.





Nothing, it was great.


















- Having everything in the cloud
- How I can create quite complex forms
- How it can turn into a CRM (turned into a one-stop-shop for my org)
- How each section can be detailed to my liking

Possibly creating any of our complex type of forms but I got my solution in the end 
Outstanding - as mentioned in the 'Pro's. It has been a 'win win' for us.

The people at Donesafe are extremely knowledgeable & do what it takes to assist the customer, they go above & beyond, they care about their brand as much as we do about ours:)
The ease of use for the end user - simplicity is best & the key to our fast paced business. The platform enables a 1 stop shot for all things safety. It allows the business to be proactive & see trends & provides the  evidence of this for us to act on an issue to reduce incidents & injuries long term.
It was an easy sell to the business with the transferring from paper based to an online system due to it's functionalities & simplicity.
The  only opportunity would be the reporting function. This functionality of the platform needs to be more user friendly in the way of creating reporti.

I was not able to identify any strengh here
Weak performance, lots of bugs, lack of fucntionality. Graham is a very arrogant person
Since implementing Donesafe we have been achieving record results in health and safety management, decreasing the repetitive work and focussing on prevention across the workplace.
It's so easy to use and made our business more efficient at handling compliance issues.  The data we are able to get and analyse has helped us prevent future issues across the workplace.
I'm looking forward to further automation features being released.
Always an easy process and no hassles
Ease of the system and documentation it is capable of 
Nothing I didn’t find useful it has many options 
Takes a bit of navigating to get familiar with. I think comments and reports Relating to pictures should be easier to fill out .
I like ease of access on mobile devices 
Some features you can’t do on mobile device compared to on the computer.
easy to use and navigate system when working in the food industry
can be confusing initially until you fully dive into it
No issues with done safe, it needs it's own app on the store ipad though. 
I love that is it all online and easy to understand
