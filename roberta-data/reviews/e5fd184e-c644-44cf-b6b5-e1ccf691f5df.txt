that I cannot view certain Focus Reports.  Focus is not user friendly on the purchases side for me
Good
This software gives much-secured access and comfort in handling.  More suitable for MSMEs.
Many limitations when we want to analyse data in different ways. 
No major benefits realized yet

Open to customize as required, which may create problems, as and when if person does not have knowledge or understand logic.
We had to go live with an ERP [comprising of Finance, Procurement and Budget Modules]. Focus was able to go live within 60 days from the project start and managed the incremental functionality upgrades in a smooth manner.
Customised report, after sales service and training the staff.
Not commonly used by CAs. New accountant needs training.
OVERALL GOOD, BUT YOU HAVE TO REVIEW YOURSELF THE CHANGES MADE ARE REFLECTED IN EACH AND EVERY REPORT AND OTHER LINKED DOCUMENTS ELSE YOUR REVISION OR CHANGES TO VOUCHER / DOCUMENTS WILL PUT YOU IN PROBLEM AS WRONG DATA WILL BE THE RESULT OF MINOR MISTAKES IN FORMULA .
ALL MODULES AVAILABLE , SALES PURCHASE, DELIVERY NOTES, MRN, INVOICING, PAYMENT
NEED TO CUSTOMIZE AND STUDY THE END USER REQUIREMENTS MINUTELY  NOT READY TO USE NEEDS TO FIT AS PER COMPANY REQUIREMENTS AND THIS LEADS TO ERRORS IN FORMULA EXECUTED BY IMPLEMENTATION TEAM.
The final reports are very easy to understand. We will get proper details in systematic.
User interface is very easy to use . Anybody can learn easily.
Focus need to improve final reports in a single page. Like other accounting software.

ITS VERY GOOD  I HOPE TO BE MORE GOOD AND 
In built report designer and user control and authorisation facilities.

I have not really come across any serious drawback on the product 
We have taken this software to enhance our experience.  And we want to have correct on time reporting. But it appears other way. 
And above all their support staff don't know anything. And they take months to solve 1 silly problems and their supports staff and managers have no manner to deal with customers. 
My humble suggestion to all don't buy this software ever. You will not get any support and you will have immense regret. Not a single report is correct and even plus minus are wrong in reports. 
POS synchronisation and on time sales recording. 
Reports .. not a single report is correct 
It could solve our software requirement but crystal report for business need require more efforts and quality check to match with direct ERP data.
Ease of use and Flexibity to adopt business needs
Payroll software need improvement and security right feature like field level security not available
MAXIMUM
CONFIDENTIALITY MAINTAINED BY FOCUS PEOPLE
