The software is simple and easy to use..
The tool interface could be more modern.
With Check_MK we realised some large scale environment, including operating system and network monitoring. We got a lot of new information for the operational staff and solve it.
I like the scalability of this monitoring product in large scale environment. Also the amount of open interfaces for automation, administration and integration of other lifecycle products. An other point is, the huge amount of monitoring solution inside Check_MK ans the easy way to add your own monitoring solution to the product. The large user community help to find solution for your own environment.
The only thing is, the user interface has too much functions.
We scraped old nagios and HP solutions and use check_mk for everything related to monitoring since 4 years. Never looked back.
Avoids most of the headaches you get with the heavyweight solutions, that spend most of the time pumping monitoring data through a classical SQL database.  Monitors eveything from network equipment, Power supply, Hardware, OS, virtualisation technology, databases, storage systems, backup and even modern stacks like docker. Also helps with automated SLA reports und software/hardware inventory. Great value for your money, there is also a community edition for tight budgets.
Because of increasing increasing popularity development of new sometimes lags behind.
Check_MK gives us all we need to monitor our server landscape. It's very stable and we did not notice major problems. It comes with a lot of useful graphs displaying current and historical data. It provides a business intelligence like feature, notofications, an event console and much more
Sometimes one might lose overview as the menus are quite "crowded"
The flexibility and the fine tuning possibilities
The difficulty to get into it. The user manual online is not complete.
Monitoring complex heterogeneous IT environments and capacit management.
The best thing about check_mk is its ability to monitor all sorts of operating systems, appliances and applications in one central place. Combined with custom checks and performance data we are using it for monitoring as well as capacity management. The compatability to nagios and it's huge plugin repository made migration from classical nagios to check_mk very easy. We have been using check_mk for 5 years and are not planning to change that in the future.  
The menu structure is unintuitive in some cases and the Web API does not make use of HTTP response codes (You get a 200 even if the call fails). The Agent output is not encrypted by default.  
The service auto-discovery with the Check_MK agent and via SNMP. No need to configure every item that should be monitored manually.
The easy usable Web-GUI that also comes with an API for automation. But still everything is in configuration files that can be viewed and edited.
Views, dashboards, bookmarks, custom graphs and graph collections that can be customized.
Over 1700 builtin checks.
A framework where plugins can be integrated easily to extend functionality of the check engine and the web application.
There is really not much I do no like about Check_MK.

We have only good experiences with Check_MK. We use it in large environment without any issues. We like the huge community of Check_MK.
The distributed setup in large scale environments. The easy install and configuration via Web Interface. Interfacing to other products like Grafana or i-Doit. Powerfull API for automation.
The Rule based configuration is powerful very fast. 
There are too many options to configure Check_MK.
- component based state monitoring:
-- all kind of servers (real, virtual; Windows, Linux, AIX, Solaris, ESX, AS400...)
-- all kind of network devices and appliances
-- full stack
- component based event monitoring
- monitoring of business processes by using the Check_MK business intelligence
- alarming via e-mails, ticketing tools, umbrella managers, SMS etc.
- Very fast and easy implementation
- Incredible low costs
- Very close communication with and fast feedback from the company behind Check_MK
- Almost complete API set for all automations need for an enterprise sized infrastructure
- Highly customisable, flexible and extensible by several plugin mechanisms
- A vast set of monitors already shipped with the product
- A very secure architecture
- A limit footprint on the monitored servers and devices
- No Java, no application server needed to run the product
- Much more, you have to experience Check_MK
To cut a long story short: to my and all of my customers opinions there is nothing to criticise.
Easy to use, even if you do not have so many knowledge on Linux, the GUI is very intuitive, one of the things which I most like on this software, is the possibility to choose any thing you want to monitoring: a service, a query, a job, or you can customize and create your own template choosing what you want to monitoring, according to your environment. Last but not least: the price, compared to the other peers is very fair. 
The price of the product is pretty fair, I can say cheap of we analyze all the features which it provides. The software is able to monitoring since a simple Linux file server, to an Active Directory, Database server, it works either on Windows or Linux. 
I do not have cons about the software, the only observation, you need to have a little knowledge on open-source\Linux\Unix plataforms to customize it better.
I think i'm very experienced. I used several setups and instances, and we're monitoring a very big branch of devices and setups and are very happy with it.
I visited both courses and i'm working for 5 years with cmk now. 
It's possible to monitor almost everything. 
If you are trained to use it, its very easy. 
It's not very easy in the beginning. Clicking trough the different views and understand where you are is very heavy in the beginning.
Documentation is still not  that useful. 
Convenience in use, and for offering monitoring of logs and events
Software documentation should be updated and more detailed
saves my time 
no more unwanted "suprises" 
- the linux-style
- an effective tool working as expected
- working command-line and api
some features are too complex for beginners (bi for example)

We deliver in a sequenced order in short interval parts to our customer (JIT/JIS).  The IT systems are crucial in the supply chain to the customer.  With check_mk we are able to alert an issue with this IT systems before it becomes a problem for the delivery process. check_mk is used in a highly distributed way at over 300 sites with one central configuration platform which allow us to quickly implement new monitoring solutions and standards.
check_mk is a very intuitive, easy to use and easy to setup monitoring system. It scales perfect vertically and also horizontal.  it provides already a huge amount of monitoring functionalities for a lot of environments and it is quite simple extensible with own functionalities. Beside state based monitoring it has also a complete solution to integrate event based monitoring. With the Business Intelligence we are able to picture our mission critical processes in monitoring and able to simulate the impact of outages to the business.
The design of the front-end is a bit vintage style and is in hour highly distributed implementation somehow slow.
I've been administrating check_mk for more than 3 years now. I honestly don't know better monitoring solution for huge number of servers. This thing scales insanely, notifications are customizable and there are integrations for every tool we use - slack, pagerduty, mail... 
They have monitoring agent plugins for almost everything you need. 
Notifications, scalability, integrations
User interface, Historical data browsing is quite bad (there is a solution for that though)
Check_MK is a phenomenal monitoring program that is constantly improving while remaining flexible enough for customizing to perfectly fit your unique monitoring needs. With the ability to write your own custom plugins in Python there is truly nothing that can't be monitored according to your specification. The fact that it can do all this on a single core, 4GB of RAM Virtual Machine is mind-blowing.
Check_MK makes it very easy monitor your environment regardless of how large you scale it. By organizing you network into logical groups (folders) you can easily create a set of monitoring parameters (thresholds, alert rules, services to monitor, etc.) and any systems added to that folder automatically get those parameters applied. Need to change the CPU alert threshold for 5000 servers? Piece of cake; simply make the change on the folder and you're all set. 

Additionally, Auto-discovery just works incredibly well at finding hosts and enumerating the services on your network hosts so that out of the box you have a pretty good idea of the overall health of network.
Up until version 1.5.0 the UI looked dated and navigation was counter intuitive at first. With version 1.5.0 they have overhauled the UI and it looks much better, but it could still use same layout changes to make it easier to understand and use.
Here a short system overview what we do with the Enterprise Version
Monitoring of about 150K services such as
- SNMP devices
- Server Linux / Windows / AIX
- SAP
- diverse applications
- Tracking of deliveries (trains & ships)
- Tracking of large vehicles for maintenance
- Control and monitoring of the building services engineering
- Automatic ticket handling in the ServiceNow
- Alerts
... and a thousand other things
What I like best:
- very steep learning curve
- conclusive operation
- very easy to define hosts and service even for beginners
- very good support (Comunity & Enterprise)
- more than 1700 plugins "out of the box
- in the community version for free
- Price performance ratio in the Enterprise Edition very good
- most of the configuration can be done via the GUI with the additional option to do it on the console

I can't think of a great thing that is constantly and actively improving the system.
Availability monitoring
SLA / IT-Service Reporting
Autodiscovery and check aggregation
Availability monitoring
autodiscovery for hosts from VCenter or Consul
