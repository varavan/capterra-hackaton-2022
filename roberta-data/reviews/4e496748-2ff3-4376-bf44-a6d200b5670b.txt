This is a great tool providing efficient services. Customization of the products and organization and tracking of data is not a tough game now. It is a robust and well supported tool for both sales personals, for IT personal and for marketing purpose too. This software also helps me know about others countryâ€™s growing Rates, when I incooperate with, exchange of knowledge and culture took place which also polish you in terms of live dealing with clients.

I think nopCommerce is very suitable for most SMEs. I have used it for more than 1,000,000 products and it works very well. The SEO infrastructure is very solid, so you won't follow a path like someone like WordPress, where you know you have to migrate in 6 months ...
We are currently using nopCommerce for its shopping cart and couponing functions. This is a very powerful and supportive platform that saves us from trying to reinvent the wheel. We have some basic needs to provide products and services that will sell and we can offer offers and coupons. You would think that this would provide more in the marketplace, but that is not the case, so we chose this solution.
Certain prices can be a bit complicated, especially for configured items. The current price of the item may be incorrect. More community templates would be great.
Great free e-commerce product - nice UI.  Fully featured!  Highly recommend!
It's great how this software is totally free, including some free plugins that extend the software even more!
I like the new UI design that recently came in.
The development team are always keeping the code and back-end technology up to date as the back-end code uses the latest .NET Core technology that's out!  Well done team.
The built-in functionality is full-featured - amazingly so actually. So many advanced features that you may not use but is always good to have in case you do.
The support team is lacking but what can you expect from a free product.  I contacted the support team on a bug that was occuring in the MailChimp module that the core team also created with no replies weeks later.

Having a work experience of more than 3 years in development, and from the beginning of my carrier using nop commerce. I can go on and on praising nop commerce. But thanks from bottom of my heart.
For developers its really big help to start any project using nop-commerce as base.
My Company has three softwares build on it.
I MeSelf have build 3 personal application for few friends and family members.
Can't repay nop commerce what they given to developers community.
Saying because I've tried building a project from scratch its really a big pain.
I just didn't like the 4.1 version of nop commerce coz its too heavy for any hosting provider, except azure and that's too costly, for a local company.

That it is .net based, and built with a solid design.
At the time adding additional fields to core objects was complicated. 
we found the implementation of this software very seemless, the plugin system allowed for all of our customisation.  as we are using it for 5k internal users instead of payment we implemented a manger approval workflow which is excellent 

over our old system this reduced the support and development effort by 95% and the business now have total ownership of the solution.

we extended the systemwith the following custom plugins:

1. Azure AD Authentication
2. Custom payment method to do manager approval
3. Custom widgets in the admin area for the above
4. Custom pages in the admin area to help the service desk manage the solution 


only con was upgrading from V4 to 4.1 as there were a few changes which broke the plugins but it was worth the trade off to be on the latest version

There are no points that can be disliked in NopCommerce
As a developer, I have successfully integrated nopCommerce in a few of my ecommerce websites. It's open source, which is great as that means there is good community support, lots of free and paid plugins. If you can't find any plugin that works, the code is very well structured and so easy to integrate. I've created my own payment gateway plugin and it just works. Customers love it as the store configuration is easy yet supports a lot of great features. Can't believe they are practically giving this away.
Opensource, community support, free/paid plugins, well stuctured code
