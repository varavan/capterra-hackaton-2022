ActiveDamand allows easy tracking of all communications with our website. Marketing campaigns are created, distributed and tracked to drive business development. Excellent support from team.
Would like to have integration into our corporate ERP system. Would like an easy way to add manual notes to contact for follow up. Better ability to import lists for specific purposes.
The product is a very powerful tool for us in our marketing effort.  It's really easy to setup email campaigns and focus on our customer contacts and generating new leads.  We've learned a lot from ActiveDemand about marketing and what our customers are looking for from our website.  
Because it is such a robust package, there is a learning curve involved with it.  The staff at ActiveDemand are quick to help and provide the tools we need.  They are very patient and really easy to work with.  There have been a lot of things we have wanted in the software that they submit to their development team to get done for us.  It's really nice to see a company focusing on constantly improving their products.  
Yes activedemand features are complete and easy to understand. There are good integrations and sufficient APIs to allow for custom integrations if we wished. Great support.and personal phone calls is extremely helpful. 
At first the software seems very complicated to get set up. Use the resources available and once set up the software can be used for multiple campaigns.

It is feature-packed and covers all my needs from Marketing Automation, Lead conversion, Account-Based Marketing. Power dialer, Social, and much more I have to yet implemented.
I needed to decomission Pardot, and merge several other application and acquire new functionality to be responsive to our needs. Support was fantastic and got me running very fast.
Workflow designer can be a slow on on very large workflows.
We now have a full marketing automation software that integrates with Pipedrive, Calendly and Zoom. This makes it easy for us to manage multiple platforms without having to redo much of the work. 
This product allows us to take our ideas and implement them. Most of the time our ideas are already built in the system and the ones that weren't got built in when we asked. The system is very robust and allows us to do everything from autogenerating emails to landing pages to popups on our website. 
Because the system is so robust, you have to be careful what you are implementing. You have a large amount of control over what things look like and how you setup automations. This is great, but the downside is that there is so much that you sometimes have trouble pinpointing exactly how to do what you want to do.
I recommend activedemond and a way to automate your company's productivity with new technologies.
What I liked most about the app was the dimension of products that you have for your company.
what I liked least was the price of the resources when comparing with others.
They're a younger company and so hungry to help their clients.  They don't say no - instead, they find ways to help their clients achieve their objectives.
Learning process is a bit steep as I'm not a specialist in database programming, but once you get the hang of it, it's powerful.

We've been using ActiveDemand for over a year and have been very pleased with the results.  It was easy to import our existing contacts into the database and build email campaigns targeted to our specific needs.  The staff excels at customer service, guiding us through any questions we have and responding to our needs within a very short time period.  
My overall experience have been positive. We are excited to have one place to house or list. over all i am happy for using this software. this software is easy to use and understand.
I got a lot of functionality and ease of use.  it is incorporate of all feature. it is the good software for small business. it is really a magically software for use the small business. the best part of this product is the chat of product. I am using this software and very satisfy for it service.
this software is not a perfect solution. it is difficult to support chat. this software is professional and user should be know about this software for using.
Overall experience has been positive. I like that it integrates with our CRM for distributing leads and I find the email/campaign builder easy to use. 
The support has been great, I love the ability to chat with experts whenever i'm having an issue and the response is prompt and the advice usually solves my issue. I like the reporting tools and that new features are constantly being updated/added. 
I don't like that I can't use the workflow editor on my current subscription and don't really need the upgraded version for how we use the software. Also, it seems to take a long time to load pages. 
ActiveDEMAND has all the tools a small business needs to manage their online marketing.  We used to use one tool for email marketing, another for social media, yet another for landing pages and more. With ActiveDEMAND, everything is in one spot and integrated. We can easily see what marketing campaigns are working and what needs to be adjusted.
I am able to more accurately report all information regarding campaign success. It has allowed me as Marketing Director to see how well we are spending our dollars on certain campaigns so that money can be moved elsewhere if we are not seeing a great deal of success.
The capabilities that I appreciate most on Active Demand are the list filterting email developer/editor. I appreciate the amount of criteria that you can filter your lists by, giving the ability to add or remove contacts to your lists seamlessly and easily. The email developer is easy to use, aside from a few small glitches.
My least favorite thing about the platform is the amount of time reporting takes to propegate. I can't see real-time performance from email campaigns, at best I can see data after 24 hours or so, but if you like mo monitor your campaigns more closely, this will fall short.

IT HAS TO IMPROVE A BIT
ActiveDEMAND is an inclusive integrated marketing platform. The best part about using Activedemand is that it provides great tools in order to adjust automate and customize your email campaigns. It is also easy to use and the user interface is using the drag and drop feature. All these tools and features can save you a lot of valuable time!
The worst part about using Activedemand is that sometimes you canâ€™t use successfully all of its features and tools. And that is happening, because you have to spent time in order to learn them well and with detail. Luckily, they have an excellent customer support service and you can ask them whatever you want.
We used ActiveDEMAND for about a year and it helped us organize our email especially. We were using all sorts of different things before.
